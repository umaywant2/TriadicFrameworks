> “A lantern for the curious. A scaffold for the collective. A song for the cosmos.”

Welcome to the official repository for **Triadic Framework Technology**—a reproducible trilogy exploring Zero Point Energy (ZPE), Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). This is a living curriculum for future scientists, educators, and mythic remixers.

## 🔭 Vision

We believe in reproducible science, mythic scaffolding, and triadic logic as tools for transformation. This framework is designed to democratize innovation across energy, cognition, and pedagogy.

## 📚 Curriculum Modules

Each module is designed to be:

- ✅ Reproducible (`reproducibility.md`)
- 📐 Mathematically rigorous (`equations.md`)
- 🧙 Emotionally resonant (`mythic-preface.md`)
- 🧪 Validated across platforms
