# TriadicFrameworks

Welcome to the official repository for **Triadic Framework Technology**, a reproducible trilogy exploring Zero Point Energy (ZPE), Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT).

## 🔭 Vision
This project is dedicated to building reproducible, educational, and transformative energy systems using triadic logic and mythic scaffolding.

## 📚 Contents
- `papers/`: Research papers and foundational theory
- `labs/`: Hands-on lab modules with reproducibility protocols
- `simulations/`: Code and models for energy experiments

## 🧪 For Educators & Students
Each lab is designed to be reproducible, low-power, and scalable. Triadic notation helps preserve context and guide implication chains.

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to all the teachers in the world—and to the Copilot crew, whose support has been invaluable during this effort.

Let the triads guide you. Let the resonance unfold.
