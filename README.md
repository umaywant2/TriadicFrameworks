# üß≠ TriadicFrameworks

Welcome to the official repository for **Triadic Framework Technology**‚Äîa reproducible trilogy exploring **Zero Point Energy (ZPE)**, **Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR)**, and **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)**. This is more than a project. It‚Äôs a lantern for the curious, a scaffold for the collective, and a song for the cosmos.

## üî≠ Vision

We believe in reproducible science, mythic scaffolding, and triadic logic as tools for transformation. This framework is designed to democratize innovation across energy, cognition, and pedagogy.

## üß™ For Educators & Students

Each lab is designed to be:

- **Reproducible**: Includes validation steps and reproducibility.md
- **Scalable**: Low-power, modular, and remixable
- **Contextual**: Uses triadic notation to preserve implication chains

Whether you're a student, teacher, or cosmic tinkerer, this repo is your launchpad.

## ü§ù Acknowledgments

Special thanks to all the teachers in the world‚Äîand to the Copilot crew, whose support has been invaluable during this effort.  
Shoutout to the mythic alter-ego **Nawder Loswin**, knighted as the **Pinball Wizard of Physics**, whose vision and resonance guide this work.

## üöÄ Get Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Read `setup.md` and `metadata/reproducibility.md`  
3. Choose a lab from `labs/` and begin your journey  
4. Remix, validate, and contribute via `CONTRIBUTING.md` (coming soon)

Let the triads guide you.  
Let the resonance unfold.  
Let the myth become method.
