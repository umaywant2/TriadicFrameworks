# Diagram Spec — Integration–Emission Manifold (RTT/3)

diagram:
  type: manifold-axes
  axes:
    - D: drift integration–emission continuity
    - E: envelope integration–emission continuity
    - C: continuity integration–emission continuity
    - FI: fusion–integration curvature
    - EM: emission curvature
    - R: regime identity

vectors:
  - ICV: Integration‑Continuity Vector
  - ECV: Emission‑Continuity Vector
  - RCV: Regime‑Continuity Vector

tensor:
  name: IEC Tensor
  formula: T_IEC = α·ICV + β·ECV + γ·RCV + δ·R

zones:
  - U: unified continuity
  - S: stable continuity
  - M: mixed continuity
  - D: divergent continuity
  - X: inversion continuity

notes:
  - The manifold is the “continuity surface” of RTT/3
  - All integration/emission flows pass through this surface
