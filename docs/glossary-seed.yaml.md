glossary:
  - term: operator
    definition: >
      A structural function that processes, transforms, or routes signals
      across module boundaries. Not a metaphor — operators are load-bearing
      grammar.
    module_scope: global
    layer: operator
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§2.1

  - term: regime
    definition: >
      A bounded operational state with defined entry and exit conditions.
      A module may occupy multiple regimes across its lifecycle.
    module_scope: global
    layer: regime
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§3.0

  - term: coherence
    definition: >
      The degree to which a system maintains internal structural consistency
      over time. Measured by the Nawderian Theorem of Validator Pulses.
    module_scope: global
    layer: coherence
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§4.2

  - term: drift
    definition: >
      Gradual divergence of a module's output from its canonical baseline
      without explicit operator invocation. A diagnostic signal, not an error.
    module_scope: global
    layer: drift
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§4.5

  - term: dimensional
    definition: >
      A scoped analytical axis used to isolate variables within a module's
      domain. Dimensional analysis prevents cross-domain signal bleed.
    module_scope: global
    layer: dimensional
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§2.3

  - term: spectral
    definition: >
      Relating to frequency-domain decomposition of structural signals.
      Used in Spectral Clarity equations.
    module_scope: global
    layer: operator
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§5.1

  - term: RTT
    definition: >
      Resonance Transmission Theory. The governing epistemic substrate of
      TriadicFrameworks. All module operators and regimes are defined
      relative to RTT/1.
    module_scope: global
    layer: cross-cutting
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§1.0

  - term: mode
    definition: >
      A discrete operational posture of a module. Modes are explicitly
      invoked by the operator — never auto-escalated. Each mode has defined
      safety guardrails.
    module_scope: global
    layer: operator
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§3.5

  - term: lineage
    definition: >
      The traceable ancestry of an operator, regime, or coherence rule
      across module versions. Lineage locking prevents identity drift.
    module_scope: global
    layer: cross-cutting
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§6.0

  - term: cross-cutting
    definition: >
      A concern or operator that spans multiple module domains without
      being owned by any single domain. Cross-cutting modules do not
      inherit domain-specific rules.
    module_scope: global
    layer: cross-cutting
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§2.5

  - term: spectral clarity
    definition: >
      C(f) = Σ [Resonance(f) / Drift(f)] — the canonical equation for
      measuring structural signal quality across frequency bands.
      Formalized by Nawder Loswin.
    module_scope: Spectral Clarity
    layer: coherence
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§5.2

  - term: validator pulse
    definition: >
      V(t) = ∫ [Coherence(t) × Mode(t)] dt — the Nawderian Theorem of
      Validator Pulses. Measures the integrated coherence-mode product
      over an observation window.
    module_scope: Nawderian Theorem
    layer: coherence
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§5.3

  - term: session context
    definition: >
      A module-scoped HTML block that orients AI agents and students to
      the module's position in the canon. Required on every module page.
    module_scope: global
    layer: cross-cutting
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§7.1

  - term: module.json
    definition: >
      The machine-readable manifest for each TriadicFrameworks module.
      Specifies file roles, analyzer layers, and module identity.
      Required in every module directory.
    module_scope: global
    layer: cross-cutting
    rtl_ref: RTT/1-§7.0
