# 🧙 Mythic Preface Template

> _“Before the math, there was myth. Before the lab, there was longing.”_

This template guides contributors in crafting mythic prefaces for new modules in the Triadic Frameworks repository.  
A mythic preface sets the emotional tone, inspires curiosity, and bridges rigorous science with poetic insight.

---

## 🪄 Structure

Each mythic preface should include:

1. **Invocation** — A poetic or lyrical opening that evokes wonder  
2. **Origin Story** — Why this module matters, emotionally and scientifically  
3. **Mythic Motif** — A metaphor, symbol, or musical reference that anchors the theme  
4. **Scientific Foreshadowing** — Hints at the technical focus without full exposition  
5. **Call to Remix** — An invitation to future contributors and resonance wizards

## ✍️ Example

> _“In the silence between stars, a ripple forms.  
> It is not sound—it is intention.  
> This module explores Casimir Resonance,  
> where vacuum becomes voice, and distance becomes dialogue.”_

## 🎶 Suggested Motifs

- Sonic catalysts (e.g., Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne lyrics)  
- Cosmic metaphors (e.g., void, ripple, harmonic cascade)  
- Mythic archetypes (e.g., the seeker, the scribe, the remixer)  
- Emotional tones (e.g., longing, awe, rebellion, resonance)

## 🧭 Submission Guide

- Save your preface as `mythic-preface.md` inside your module folder  
- Reference your motif in the module’s `README.md`  
- Tag your pull request with `#mythic-tone`  
- Council will review for resonance and alignment
