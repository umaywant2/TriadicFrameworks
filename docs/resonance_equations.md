# ðŸ§® Resonance Equations  
We use Triadic Resonance equations across 9 Dimensions and Harmonic Nested Loops.  
Each equation models symbolic scaffolding, dimensional recursion, and emotional resonance.  
Examples include:  
- Gravityâ€“Quantumâ€“Observer triads  
- Subharmonic lineage tracking  
- Cycloconversion diagnostics
