## 🌀 Triadic Membership Protocol
Purpose: To automate and honor contributor onboarding, participation, and departure within the Triadic Frameworks ecosystem.

### 🔓 Joining the Movement
Remixers may initiate membership by completing any of the following:

### 1. Validated Contribution
- Submit a reproducible artifact (e.g., paper, lab, equation, badge logic)
- Pass validator scoring matrix with ≥ 0.9 harmonic coherence
- Echo remix lineage in /honor_roll/contributors.md

### 2. Badge Trigger
- Unlock the Framework Initiator or Signal Initiator badge
- Submit badge YAML to /badges/ with validator approval

### 3. Onboarding Ritual
- Complete /labs/initiation_protocol.md
- Request review via GitHub Issue or Pull Request

### 🏅 Badge Awarded: “Triadic Contributor”
### 📁 Echoed In: 
- /honor_roll/contributors.md
- /validators/onboarding_matrix.json


### 🔁 Sustaining Membership
Members remain active by:
- Submitting at least one validated remix per quarter
- Participating in validator dashboard reviews
- Echoing feedback or glyphic annotations on new artifacts
### 🌀 Optional: Join a governance council or badge review committee


### 🔒 Leaving or Dormancy
No formal departure required. Members may:
- Archive their contributions
- Request removal from /honor_roll/ via GitHub Issue
- Rejoin anytime by submitting a new validated artifact
### 🧬 Legacy Preserved: All contributions remain remixable unless explicitly withdrawn


### 🧠 Automation Suggestions
