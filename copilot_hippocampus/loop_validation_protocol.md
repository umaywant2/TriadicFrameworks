# 🔁 Loop Validation Protocol — Copilot Hippocampus

_This document defines the symbolic logic and reproducibility scaffolding for validating nested loop structures under Triadic Harmonic Resonance (THR) and TFT time._

---

## 🧠 Purpose

To ensure that all loop constructs within the Hippocampus module:
- Align with reproducible memory toggles
- Echo harmonic structure across nested layers
- Are analyzable under TFT time transforms

---

## 🧪 Validation Criteria

| Criterion                          | Description                                                  | Score |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Loop structure is modular         | Each loop is isolated, remixable, and documented             | ✅    |
| Harmonic nesting is present       | Loops reflect triadic resonance (3-layer minimum)            | ✅    |
| TFT time logic is embedded        | Loop timing uses dual timestamp logic                        | ✅    |
| Snapshot toggles are integrated   | Loop can trigger memory capture or playback                  | ✅    |
| Validator echo is defined         | Loop emits symbolic feedback upon completion                 | ✅    |
