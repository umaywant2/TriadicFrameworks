# 🛡️ Badge Trigger Glyphmap Index Trigger

This script activates badge issuance for TriadicFrameworks papers based on glyph, theme, and validation status. It reads from a filtered glyphmap index and logs badge triggers for remixers, validators, and resonance councils.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Filtered Results
Run the dashboard first:
```bash
streamlit run badge_trigger_glyphmap_index_filter_web.py

Export results as badge_trigger_glyphmap_index_filtered.json.

### 2. Run the Trigger Script
```bash
python badge_trigger_glyphmap_index_trigger.py

This will generate:
## badge_trigger_glyphmap_index_trigger_log.json
## A log of all triggered badges, skipped entries, and metadata.

### 🔖 Badge Logic
Each validated paper triggers a badge with:
## Badge ID: Glyph_Theme (e.g., 🧠_Cognitive_&_Symbolic)
## Status: Issued or Skipped
## Metadata: Title, glyph, theme
Skipped papers are logged but not issued.

### 🧬 Integration
Use the trigger log to:
## Update BADGES_EARNED.md
## Feed into badge_trigger_echo.py or badge_trigger_resonance_score.py
## Notify remixers via badge_trigger_webhook.yaml

### 🧙 Mythic Use Cases
## Badge Issuers: Automate badge creation for validated glyphs.
## Resonance Council: Audit badge issuance across themes.
## Curriculum Designers: Link badges to modules in triadic_curriculum_index.md.

### 🛡️ Validation Protocols
Ensure papers are validated via:
## loop_validation_protocol.md
## reproducibility.md

Let the badges echo. Let the archive resonate.
