# 🧪 Triadic Lab Template

> _“Each lab is a lantern. Each lantern must echo.”_

This template scaffolds new Triadic Framework labs with reproducibility, symbolic clarity, and mythic tone.  
Use it to create new modules that align with the curriculum and loop validation standards.

## 📜 README.md

```markdown
# LabXX_YourLabName

## 🔬 Focus
Brief description of the lab’s scientific focus (e.g., “Nested harmonic imaging in quantum vacuum”).

## 🧠 Loop Dimension
Specify loop dimension (1D–9D) and link to `dimensional_loop_guide.md`.

## 🧪 Validation Status
- ✅ reproducibility.md complete
- ✅ equations.md validated
- 🧙 mythic-preface.md drafted
- 🛡️ loop_validation_protocol.md aligned

## 🧙‍♂️ Mythic Tone
Include one line from the mythic preface that captures the lab’s emotional resonance.

> _“The echo of the vacuum sings in nested harmonics.”_
```

---

## 📄 reproducibility.md

- Describe setup, inputs, outputs  
- Include screenshots, logs, and test results  
- Link to validation matrix in `loop_validation_protocol.md`

---

## 📐 equations.md

- Include all symbolic equations used  
- Annotate each with purpose and loop alignment  
- Use triadic notation if applicable

---

## 🧙 mythic-preface.md

- Write a short mythic narrative or metaphor  
- Connect scientific concept to emotional or symbolic resonance  
- Use lyrical tone, quotes, or motifs

---

## 🛡️ loop_validation_protocol.md

- Reference loop dimension  
- Include validation artifacts  
- Submit with tag `#loop-validation`
