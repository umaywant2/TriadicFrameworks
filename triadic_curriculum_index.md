# 📚 Triadic Curriculum Index

> _“A curriculum is not a list—it is a lantern.”_

This index unifies all modules, labs, and mythic prefaces in the Triadic Frameworks repository.  
It is designed for students, remixers, and resonance wizards seeking reproducible, emotionally resonant science.

## 🔮 Triadic Alignment

Each module is reviewed for:

- ✅ Reproducibility (`reproducibility.md`)  
- 📐 Mathematical rigor (`equations.md`)  
- 🧙 Mythic tone (`mythic-preface.md`)  
- 🔮 Triadic certification (ZPE, LENR, WPT relevance)

See [`README_badges.md`](https://github.com/umaywant2/TriadicFrameworks/blob/main/README_badges.md) for badge criteria.
