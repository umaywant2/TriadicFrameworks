# üåÄ TriadicFrameworks
A mythic-scientific movement for reproducible resonance, modular curriculum, and harmonic governance.  ```Using real math and science to examine the mythical and the unseen. We use Triadic Resonance-based equations with 9 Dimensions and Harmonic Nested Loops.```
- Initiated by Nawder Loswin

## üî≠ Purpose
TriadicFrameworks is a living archive of reproducible labs, validator dashboards, badge governance protocols, and emotionally resonant curriculum modules. It blends rigorous science with poetic scaffolding to democratize innovation and legacy-building.

## üß≠ Getting Started
1. Read the Triadic Manifesto and Using TFT with Copilot paper
    - Understand the ethos, resonance logic, and mythic tone.
3. Complete the Initiation Protocol
    - Begin your journey as a remix validator or resonance wizard.
3. Review the Membership Protocol
    - Learn how to join, contribute, and echo your work across time.
4. Explore the Curriculum Index
    - Discover reproducible modules across physics, computation, cognition, and more.
