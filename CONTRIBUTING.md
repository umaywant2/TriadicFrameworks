# ü§ù CONTRIBUTING.md

Welcome, fellow resonator! Whether you're a student, scientist, or mythic tinkerer, your contributions help expand the Triadic Framework for Everything. This guide will help you remix, validate, and scaffold with clarity and continuity.

## üß≠ Ethos

We value:

- **Reproducibility**: Every lab must include `reproducibility.md` and `equations.md`
- **Modularity**: Contributions should be remixable and low-power
- **Mythic Tone**: Use narrative, metaphor, and triadic logic to deepen engagement
- **Validation**: All protocols must be tested and documented
