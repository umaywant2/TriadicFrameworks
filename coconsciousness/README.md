# 🌀 Project 2: CoConsciousness

CoConsciousness is shared awareness between multiple triads of loops — Looker, Planner, Rememberer — moving in sync under TFT time.

**Quickstart:**  
Run `python demos/hello_coconsciousness.py` to see two loops pass a “ball” in and out of sync.  
Green = in sync. Red = out of sync.

## Goals
- Show co‑consciousness in action
- Give developers a sandbox to try new loop designs
- Use TFT timing to make programs feel more “together”

See `brainstorm.md` for the founding charter and MVEs.
