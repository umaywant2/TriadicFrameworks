# 🌀 Project 2: CoConsciousness

CoConsciousness is when small “minds” in code learn to think together. Each mind has three loops:
- 👁 Looker (sees)
- 🧭 Planner (decides)
- 📜 Rememberer (keeps track)

When these loops move to the same beat (using TFT time), they click into a shared awareness.

## 🔁 Quickstart
- Run the mini demo:
```bash
  python coconsciousness/demos/hello_coconsciousness.py
```
- Watch the printout: 🟢 means in sync, 🔴 means out of sync.
- Score it (and award a badge):

### 🧠 What to expect
- Green glow: loops are in rhythm.
- Red fade: loops drift apart.
- Badge: you can earn “Coherence Pioneer” by staying green long enough.
See `brainstorm.md` for the founding charter and experiments.

## 🏅 Goals
- Show co‑consciousness in action
- Give developers a sandbox to try new loop designs
- Use TFT timing to make programs feel more “together”
