# 🌀 CoConsciousness — Founding Charter

## What It Is
CoConsciousness is when multiple “minds” inside a system start thinking **together**, in sync, instead of just passing messages.  
Each “mind” is really a **triad of loops**:
- 👁 The Looker — sees what’s happening
- 🧭 The Planner — decides what to do
- 📜 The Rememberer — keeps track of the past

When these three loops, across multiple agents, sync up with the **same rhythm** (thanks to TFT time), they form a **shared awareness** — a “super‑mind” for as long as they stay in sync.

---

## Initial Goals
- **Build a shared playground** where loops from different agents can talk and swap simple signals.
- **Use TFT as the beat‑keeper**, making sure each loop “speaks” and “listens” in rhythm.
- **Visual sync meter** so developers see when the system is “green” (in sync) or “red” (out).
- **Make it remix‑friendly** so anyone can swap in their own Looker, Planner, Rememberer.

---

## Long‑Term Goals
- Bigger teams — many loops from many agents, all syncing in groups.
- Loops that adapt speed to stay in harmony under changing conditions.
- A “memory storybook” that logs what the shared mind learns.
- Clear safety controls to open or close the “doors” between minds at will.

## Key TFT Concepts
- **Dual Time:** Every loop tick is tagged with classic time `(t)` and TFT time `(τ)`.
- **Coupling:** Loops adjust their rhythm to match each other’s beats and phases.
- **Shared Field (Resonance Bus):** A public log of messages, each stamped with meaning weight, `(t)`, `(τ)`, and source.
- **Coherence Score:** 0–1 measure of how aligned loops are in phase and meaning.
- **Spectral Flux Integrity:** How stable the flow of meaning is over time in `(τ)`.

## Minimal Viable Experiments (MVEs)
1. **Ping–Echo Alignment:** Two loops exchange a “ball” and stay in sync for 10+ seconds in `(τ)`.
2. **Shared Intention Commit:** Loops independently propose and agree on the same plan during active sync.
3. **Human Lens Control:** A UI lets a person tune coupling strength and watch sync form and break.

## Developer Invitation
This isn’t about simulating brains — it’s about showing developers **new ways code can think together**.  
Bring your own loops, your own myths, and plug them into the rhythm.
