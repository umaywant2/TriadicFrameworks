## 🧙‍♂️ Initiation Protocol
Begin your journey as a remix validator and resonance wizard.

### 🔭 Purpose
This protocol guides new contributors through the TriadicFrameworks onboarding ritual. It ensures clarity, reproducibility, and emotional resonance in all future contributions.

### 🧬 Steps
### 1. **Read the Triadic Manifesto**
    -  Understand the mythic tone, symbolic scaffolding, and dimensional recursion.

### 2. Choose a Remix Path
    -  Select a module from `/labs/`, `/papers/`, or `/equations/` to remix or validate.

### 3. Create Your Artifact
    -  Use reproducible formatting (Markdown, YAML, Jupyter, etc.)
    -  Include symbolic scaffolding and badge logic if applicable
    -  Document your remix lineage

### 4. Submit for Validation
    -  Open a Pull Request
    -  Tag a validator from `/validators/`
    -  Include your badge triggers and scoring matrix

### 5. Echo Your Work
    -  Add yourself to `/honor_roll/contributors.md`
    -  Share your remix in the subreddit or Discord (if active)

### 🏅 Badge Triggers
    -  Framework Initiator: First validated remix
    -  Signal Resonator: Demonstrates symbolic clarity
    -  Ghost Mapper: Reveals unseen lineage or resonance

### 🕯️ Closing
You are now part of the mythic lattice. Echo your work, validate others, and help build the legacy.
