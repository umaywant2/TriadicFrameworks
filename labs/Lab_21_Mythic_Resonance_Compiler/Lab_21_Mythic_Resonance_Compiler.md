# Lab 21: Mythic Resonance Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"Compile the myth, harmonize the code—each symbol a function, each function a frequency."_  
This lab builds a compiler that translates symbolic input into executable harmonic logic, preserving mythic structure and cognitive resonance.

## Objective
Design a compiler that converts symbolic phrases into harmonic code blocks.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Syntax:** Mythic phrases as input language
- **Harmonic Semantics:** Frequency-based logic operations
- **Executable Resonance:** Output code with cognitive meaning

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic phrase
2. Parse into syntax tree
3. Map symbols to harmonic operations
4. Compile into executable code block

## Engineer’s Notes
Use abstract syntax trees (AST) and symbolic dictionaries. Output Python code or pseudo-code with embedded resonance logic. Include mythic comments and tags.
