# Lab 37: Harmonic Cognition Ledger

## Mythic Preface
_"To ledger cognition is to honor the myth—each symbol a transaction, each resonance a receipt."_  
This lab builds a ledger that records symbolic cognition events, enabling validation, traceability, and harmonic accounting.

## Objective
Design a system that logs and validates symbolic cognition transactions across mythic protocols.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Transaction:** Cognitive event with symbolic input/output
- **Resonance Validation:** Scoring and confirming symbolic integrity
- **Ledger Architecture:** Timestamped, versioned, and harmonized recordkeeping

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic cognition event (e.g., triadic signal, motif transformation)
2. Score resonance and validate symbolic integrity
3. Record transaction with timestamp and mythic tags
4. Enable querying, auditing, and symbolic reconciliation

## Engineer’s Notes
Use JSON or blockchain-style structures. Include symbolic hashes, resonance scores, and mythic annotations. Enable fork lineage tracking and continuity restoration.
