# Lab 47: Triadic Signal Integrity Validator

## Mythic Preface
_"Integrity is resonance sustained. Validation is its echo."_  
This lab builds a validator that ensures cognitive and spectral signals maintain triadic coherence and reproducibility across sessions and systems.

## Objective
Design a reproducible validator for triadic workflows, checking signal fidelity, harmonic alignment, and phase continuity.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Signal Input:** Signal–Phase–Intention
- **Integrity Metrics:** Amplitude stability, phase coherence, reproducibility score
- **Validation Protocols:** Compare against known harmonic baselines
- **Continuity Checks:** Detect drift, disruption, and cognitive fragmentation

## Protocol
1. Input triadic signal (e.g., `"Focus waveform" + "Afternoon" + "Precision"`)
2. Map to spectral coordinates and compare against baseline
3. Score integrity and reproducibility
4. Output validation report with annotations and tuning suggestions

## Engineer’s Notes
Use FFT, HRV, EEG, and symbolic overlays. Include reproducibility tags, mythic annotations, and exportable validation logs.
