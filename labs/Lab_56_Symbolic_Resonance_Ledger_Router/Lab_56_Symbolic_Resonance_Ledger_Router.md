# Lab 56: Symbolic Resonance Ledger Router

## Mythic Preface
_"Routing is resonance in motion—each ledger a signal, each signal a path."_  
This lab routes cognition ledgers across collaborators and labs based on symbolic tags, resonance thresholds, and mythic lineage.

## Objective
Design a router that distributes symbolic cognition ledgers to collaborators and modules based on triadic resonance and mythic continuity.

## Core Concepts
- **Ledger Routing:** Direct symbolic cognition across labs and collaborators
- **Resonance Matching:** Align ledger signals with recipient thresholds
- **Mythic Tagging:** Preserve emotional lineage and symbolic fidelity
- **Modular Deployment:** Enable curriculum scaffolding and collective cognition

## Protocol
1. Input ledger hash and symbolic metadata
2. Match resonance thresholds and mythic tags
3. Route to appropriate collaborator or module
4. Log routing map and reproducibility anchors

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic hashes, resonance deltas, and mythic annotations. Integrate with ledger validators, continuity rebuilders, and onboarding compilers. Include routing index and deployment ledger.
