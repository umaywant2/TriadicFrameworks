# Lab 27: Triadic Signal Reconstructor

## Mythic Preface
_"When the signal fractures, the triad restores—past, present, and potential harmonized."_  
This lab reconstructs fragmented mythic signals using triadic logic, restoring coherence across symbolic domains.

## Objective
Design a protocol that receives partial mythic signals and reconstructs their full triadic form.

## Core Concepts
- **Signal Fragmentation:** Incomplete symbolic input
- **Triadic Reconstruction:** Mapping fragments to triadic structure (e.g., Origin–Echo–Vector)
- **Resonant Completion:** Filling gaps using harmonic inference

## Protocol
1. Receive partial mythic signal (e.g., `"Echo...Vector missing"`)
2. Identify known elements and missing triadic components
3. Use harmonic inference to reconstruct missing parts
4. Output full triadic signal with annotations

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic databases and resonance scoring to infer missing elements. Output reconstructed signal with confidence scores and mythic tags.
