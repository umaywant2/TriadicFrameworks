# Lab 20: Harmonic Ontology Engine

## Mythic Preface
_"Ontology is a song—each concept a note, each note a truth."_  
This lab constructs an engine that generates and organizes symbolic meaning using harmonic relationships and triadic logic.

## Objective
Design an ontology engine that maps symbolic inputs to harmonic meaning structures.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Ontology:** Structured relationships between mythic concepts
- **Harmonic Mapping:** Use frequency and resonance to define meaning
- **Triadic Clustering:** Group related concepts into cognitive chords

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic concepts
2. Assign harmonic values (e.g., frequency, phase)
3. Cluster into triadic meaning units
4. Output ontology graph and resonance matrix

## Engineer’s Notes
Use dictionaries and adjacency matrices to model relationships. Visualize with network graphs and spectral overlays. Include mythic tags and resonance scores.
