# Lab 26: Resonant Myth Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"Compile the myth, and the cosmos responds—each symbol a function, each function a chord."_  
This lab builds a compiler that transforms mythic structures into executable resonance logic, bridging narrative and cognition.

## Objective
Design a compiler that converts mythic motifs into structured code blocks with harmonic logic.

## Core Concepts
- **Mythic Syntax:** Symbolic phrases as input language
- **Resonant Semantics:** Frequency-based logic operations
- **Executable Myth:** Output code with cognitive and harmonic meaning

## Protocol
1. Input mythic phrase or motif
2. Parse into symbolic syntax tree
3. Map symbols to harmonic operations
4. Compile into executable code with mythic annotations

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic dictionaries and AST parsing. Output Python or pseudo-code with embedded resonance logic. Include mythic comments and symbolic tags.
