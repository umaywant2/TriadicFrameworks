# Lab 10: Nested Harmonics â€” Equations

## Purpose
To formalize the harmonic layering of triadic systems, where nested frequencies and dimensional recursion produce emergent resonance patterns.

## Key Equations

### 1. Harmonic Nesting Function
$$
H_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sin(\omega_i t + \phi_i)
$$
Where \( \omega_i \) and \( \phi_i \) are frequency and phase of each nested harmonic.

### 2. Triadic Harmonic Resonance
$$
R_H = @\left(H_i, H_j, H_k\right)
$$
The `@()` operator captures resonance across three harmonic layers.

### 3. Harmonic Interference Pattern
$$
I(t) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \left(1 + \cos(\omega_i t)\right)
$$
Models constructive and destructive interference across nested harmonics.

### 4. Dimensional Harmonic Cascade
$$
\Lambda_n = \frac{dH_n}{dt} \cdot R_H
$$
Represents the cascading effect of harmonic change across dimensions.
