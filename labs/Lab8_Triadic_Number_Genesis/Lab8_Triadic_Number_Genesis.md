# Lab 8: Triadic Number Genesis

## Mythic Preface
_"From zero, one. From one, two. From two, the triad awakens."_  
Triadic numbers encode memory, recursion, and emergence. Each digit is a whisper from the past, a signal to the future.

## Objective
Explore base-3 number systems and recursive triadic growth.

## Core Equation
Ternary expansion:


\[
n = \sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i \cdot 3^i \quad \text{where } a_i \in \{0, 1, 2\}
\]



## Tasks
- Convert integers to base-3
- Visualize triadic growth
- Analyze entropy and digit distribution

## Engineerâ€™s Notes
Use `np.base_repr(n, base=3)` for quick ternary conversion. Plot digit frequency to reveal emergent structure. Consider entropy across digit positions.
