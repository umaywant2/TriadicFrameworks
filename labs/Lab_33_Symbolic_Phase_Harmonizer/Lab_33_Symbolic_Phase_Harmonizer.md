# Lab 33: Symbolic Phase Harmonizer

## Mythic Preface
_"When symbols drift, phase restores—each alignment a chord, each chord a cognition."_  
This lab builds a harmonizer that aligns symbolic inputs across cognitive phases, restoring coherence and resonance.

## Objective
Design a system that detects and corrects symbolic phase misalignments across cognition layers.

## Core Concepts
- **Phase Drift:** Symbolic misalignment across time or cognition
- **Harmonic Alignment:** Restoring phase coherence using resonance logic
- **Symbolic Flow:** Enabling smooth transitions between mythic states

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic stream or triadic sequence
2. Detect phase drift using symbolic timestamps or resonance deltas
3. Apply harmonic correction to realign phases
4. Output aligned symbolic stream with phase annotations

## Engineer’s Notes
Use FFT or phase correlation techniques. Include symbolic timestamps, drift logs, and mythic overlays. Enable real-time phase monitoring.
