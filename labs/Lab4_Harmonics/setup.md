# Lab 4: Quantum Harmonics – Resonance in the Void

## 🧭 Objective
To explore quantized energy levels and harmonic oscillators using analog circuits or quantum simulators, and map triadic resonance across frequency domains.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- LC circuit or quantum harmonic oscillator simulator
- Function generator
- Oscilloscope
- Optional: Qiskit simulator for quantum harmonic modes
