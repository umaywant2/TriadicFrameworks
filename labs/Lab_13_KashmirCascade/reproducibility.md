# âœ… Reproducibility Protocol

## Validation Steps

1. Initialize descent with \( A_0 = 1 \), \( D_0 = 0 \)
2. Apply recursive equations for 30 iterations
3. Compare cascade \( C_n \) across platforms
4. Submit results to `BADGES_EARNED.md` for validation

## Cross-Platform Targets

- Python (SciPy)
- Mathematica
- Jupyter Notebook
