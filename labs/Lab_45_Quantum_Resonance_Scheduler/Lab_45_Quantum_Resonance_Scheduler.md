# Lab 45: Quantum Resonance Scheduler

## Mythic Preface
_"Time is not a line. It is a lattice of resonance."_  
This lab builds a scheduler that aligns cognitive tasks with quantum phase windows and triadic harmonics—turning calendars into cognition engines.

## Objective
Design a reproducible scheduler that assigns tasks based on quantum phase logic and triadic resonance scoring.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Task Input:** Task–Phase–Intention
- **Quantum Phase Mapping:** Use modular time blocks and entangled task states
- **Resonance Scoring:** Match task to optimal quantum window
- **Scheduler Output:** Generate reproducible calendar with harmonic annotations

## Protocol
1. Input triadic task (e.g., `"Design protocol" + "Afternoon" + "Precision"`)
2. Map each to quantum phase coordinates (modular time, entangled state)
3. Score resonance with current cognitive and environmental state
4. Output scheduled time block with harmonic justification

## Engineer’s Notes
Use modular arithmetic, entanglement logic, and HRV/EEG data. Integrate with existing calendar APIs. Include reproducibility tags and mythic annotations.
