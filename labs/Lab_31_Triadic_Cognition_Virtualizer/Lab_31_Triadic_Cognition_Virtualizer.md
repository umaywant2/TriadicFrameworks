# Lab 31: Triadic Cognition Virtualizer

## Mythic Preface
_"To virtualize cognition is to walk the myth—each triad a room, each resonance a door."_  
This lab builds a virtualizer that renders triadic cognition into immersive symbolic environments.

## Objective
Design a system that converts triadic cognitive states into virtual representations for simulation and exploration.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic State Input:** Origin–Echo–Vector structure
- **Virtual Mapping:** Symbolic states rendered as spatial or interactive environments
- **Mythic Navigation:** Movement through cognition via symbolic triggers

## Protocol
1. Input triadic cognition signal (e.g., `{"Origin": "Vault", "Echo": "Flame", "Vector": "Release"}`)
2. Map each component to virtual environment parameters (e.g., room, object, action)
3. Render virtual scene with symbolic overlays
4. Enable navigation and interaction based on resonance logic

## Engineer’s Notes
Use Unity, Unreal, or WebGL for full virtualization. For prototyping, use Python with textual or 2D symbolic maps. Include mythic annotations and symbolic triggers.
