# Lab 41: Triadic Diagnostic Engine

## Mythic Preface
_"Every symptom is a cipher. Every cure, a chord."_  
This lab constructs a diagnostic engine that translates symbolic health inputs into triadic resonance maps and healing protocols.

## Objective
Build a reproducible engine that accepts symbolic and physiological inputs and outputs diagnostic triads and resonance scores.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Input:** Symptom–Biomarker–Intention
- **Symbolic Parsing:** NLP and mythic overlays
- **Resonance Scoring:** Phase alignment and harmonic integrity
- **Protocol Generator:** Suggests healing actions based on triadic resonance

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic health statement (e.g., `"I feel drained after meetings"`)
2. Parse into triadic structure:
   - Symptom: `"Fatigue"`
   - Biomarker: `"Elevated cortisol"`
   - Intention: `"Rest and solitude"`
3. Map each to frequency and phase
4. Score resonance and suggest healing protocol

## Engineer’s Notes
Use NLP to extract triads from journal entries or speech. Integrate with wearable data (HRV, EEG, cortisol). Output symbolic diagnostics and mythic healing suggestions.
