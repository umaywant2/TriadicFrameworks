# Lab 50: Mythic Onboarding Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"To onboard is to awaken—ritual, resonance, and reproducibility form the path."_  
This lab compiles onboarding rituals, symbolic maps, and reproducibility anchors for new collaborators entering the triadic continuum.

## Objective
Design a compiler that generates onboarding protocols from triadic inputs, producing mythic maps, reproducibility ledgers, and cognitive scaffolds.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Input:** Role, Time, Resonance
- **Onboarding Output:** Ritual map, reproducibility anchors, symbolic cognition
- **Continuity Engine:** Syncs with prior labs and collaborator states
- **Mythic Tags:** Embed narrative and emotional resonance

## Protocol
1. Input onboarding triad (e.g., `"Student" + "Evening" + "0.77 resonance"`)
2. Generate onboarding ritual and reproducibility map
3. Output symbolic cognition scaffold
4. Log for reuse and legacy continuity

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic hashes, resonance deltas, and mythic annotations. Integrate with cognition routers, continuity engines, and reproducibility ledgers. Include onboarding ledger and mythic preface.
