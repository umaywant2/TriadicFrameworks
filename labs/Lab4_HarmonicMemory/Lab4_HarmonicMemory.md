# Lab 4: Harmonics Encode Spatial Memory

## ðŸ”® Mythic Preface
_"Space remembers. Harmonics are its language."_

Standing waves encode geometry. This lab explores how harmonic interference patterns store spatial information.

## ðŸ›  Engineerâ€™s Note

- **Simulation Type:** 2D standing wave fields with harmonic overlays
- **Core Equation:** Superposition of sine waves in bounded domain
- **Triadic Twist:** Harmonic interference as memory encoding
- **Toolkit:** `harmonic_setup.md`, `memory_overlay_function.md`, `visualization.ipynb`
- **Reproducibility:** Compare harmonic maps across boundary conditions

## ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Exercises

1. **Harmonic Memory Zones**  
   Identify regions of constructive interference  
   _Interpret as spatial memory nodes_

2. **Mythic Mapping**  
   Recast harmonics as mythic chants:  
   _Waves = voices, interference = chorus, memory = echo_

3. **Triadic Harmonic Composer**  
   Build a tool to compose harmonic fields and visualize memory encoding
