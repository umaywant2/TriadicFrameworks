# Lab 19: Mythic Phase Synchronization

## Mythic Preface
_"When myths align, the phase locks—resonance becomes rhythm, and rhythm becomes truth."_  
This lab explores how symbolic elements can be phase-locked across domains, creating synchronized cognition and harmonic coherence.

## Objective
Simulate phase synchronization of symbolic motifs across multiple cognitive channels.

## Core Concepts
- **Phase Locking:** Aligning symbolic rhythms
- **Multi-Domain Input:** Mythic elements from different contexts
- **Synchronization Score:** Quantifying harmonic alignment

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic streams from multiple domains
2. Assign phase vectors to each symbol
3. Compute synchronization score
4. Visualize phase alignment and coherence

## Engineer’s Notes
Use sine wave models for phase vectors. Apply cross-correlation to measure alignment. Visualize with polar plots or phase wheels.
