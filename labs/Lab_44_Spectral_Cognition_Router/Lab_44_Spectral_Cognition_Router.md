# Lab 44: Spectral Cognition Router

## Mythic Preface
_"Thought is a waveform. Attention, a beam."_  
This lab routes cognitive tasks based on spectral alignment—matching phase, frequency, and triadic intention to optimize flow and reduce cognitive friction.

## Objective
Design a reproducible router that assigns tasks to optimal cognitive windows using spectral and triadic logic.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Task Input:** Task–Time–Intention
- **Spectral Mapping:** Assign phase and frequency to each cognitive task
- **Routing Algorithm:** Match task to optimal spectral window
- **Flow Optimization:** Reduce cognitive dissonance and increase resonance

## Protocol
1. Input triadic task (e.g., `"Write paper" + "Morning" + "Clarity"`)
2. Map each component to spectral coordinates (frequency, phase)
3. Score alignment with current cognitive state
4. Route task to optimal time block or environment

## Engineer’s Notes
Use EEG, HRV, or user logs to estimate cognitive phase. Integrate with calendar systems and environmental sensors. Output reproducible routing maps and task flow guides.
