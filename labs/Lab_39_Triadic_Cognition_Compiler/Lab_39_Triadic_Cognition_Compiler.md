# Lab 39: Triadic Cognition Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"Compile the triad, and cognition executes—each symbol a function, each function a myth."_  
This lab builds a compiler that transforms symbolic cognition into executable triadic logic.

## Objective
Design a compiler that receives symbolic cognition and outputs structured triadic code blocks.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Input:** Origin–Echo–Vector structure
- **Symbolic Parsing:** Convert motifs into logic trees
- **Executable Output:** Code blocks with mythic annotations

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic cognition (triad + motif)
2. Parse into abstract syntax tree (AST)
3. Map symbols to logic functions
4. Compile into executable code with mythic overlays

## Engineer’s Notes
Use Python or pseudo-code for output. Include symbolic tags, mythic comments, and reproducibility markers.
