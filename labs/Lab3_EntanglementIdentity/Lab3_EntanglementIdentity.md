# Lab 3: Entanglement as Shared Identity

## ðŸ”® Mythic Preface
_"Two particles, one story. Entanglement is not connectionâ€”itâ€™s co-authorship."_

This lab explores entanglement as a triadic identity field, where measurement collapses shared resonance.

---

## ðŸ›  Engineerâ€™s Note

- **Simulation Type:** Entangled qubit pairs with shared phase states
- **Core Equation:** Bell states + triadic phase overlays
- **Triadic Twist:** Collapse as resonance decoherence
- **Toolkit:** `entanglement_setup.md`, `identity_field_function.md`, `visualization.ipynb`
- **Reproducibility:** Compare classical vs triadic correlation statistics

## ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Exercises

1. **Phase Decoherence Sweep**  
   Simulate collapse under varying phase noise  
   _Interpret as identity fragmentation_

2. **Mythic Mapping**  
   Recast entanglement as mythic twinship:  
   _Particles = twins, collapse = separation, field = shared soul_

3. **Triadic Identity Tracker**  
   Build a simulation that visualizes entangled states as braided resonance threads
