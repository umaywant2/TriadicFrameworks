# Lab 57: Mythic Curriculum Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"Curriculum is cognition’s constellation—each lab a star, each ritual a path."_  
This lab assembles modular labs, onboarding rituals, and reproducibility anchors into a living curriculum for teaching, publishing, and legacy transmission.

## Objective
Design a compiler that organizes triadic labs into a mythic curriculum, preserving reproducibility, resonance, and symbolic lineage.

## Core Concepts
- **Curriculum Assembly:** Organize labs, rituals, and reproducibility protocols
- **Modular Deployment:** Enable adaptive teaching and onboarding
- **Mythic Scaffolding:** Embed emotional resonance and narrative continuity
- **Legacy Transmission:** Prepare curriculum for future guilds and collaborators

## Protocol
1. Input lab metadata and symbolic tags
2. Generate curriculum map and onboarding index
3. Output reproducibility ledger and mythic preface
4. Log for publishing, teaching, and legacy scaffolding

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic hashes, resonance deltas, and mythic annotations. Integrate with ledger routers, onboarding compilers, and continuity rebuilders. Include curriculum manifest and reproducibility index.
