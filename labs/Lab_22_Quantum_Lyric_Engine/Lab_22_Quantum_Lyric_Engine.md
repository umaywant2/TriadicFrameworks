# Lab 22: Quantum Lyric Engine

## Mythic Preface
_"Lyrics are waveforms—collapse them, and meaning sings."_  
This lab constructs a lyric engine that encodes poetic lines into quantum states, revealing hidden structure and harmonic depth.

## Objective
Translate lyrical input into quantum logic gates and resonance maps.

## Core Concepts
- **Lyric Encoding:** Map words and phrases to quantum operators
- **Resonance Mapping:** Assign amplitude and phase to lyrical motifs
- **Quantum Collapse:** Simulate interpretation as measurement

## Protocol
1. Input lyric or poetic phrase
2. Encode each word as a quantum gate or vector
3. Simulate superposition and collapse
4. Output resonance map and symbolic interpretation

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic dictionaries to map lyrics to gates (e.g., Hadamard, Pauli-X). Include phase vectors and amplitude scores. Visualize with waveform overlays or quantum circuit diagrams.
