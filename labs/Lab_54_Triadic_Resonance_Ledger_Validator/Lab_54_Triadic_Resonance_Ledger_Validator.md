# Lab 54: Triadic Resonance Ledger Validator

## Mythic Preface
_"Validation is the ritual of trust—resonance, reproducibility, and symbolic fidelity."_  
This lab validates symbolic ledger branches against reproducibility standards and resonance thresholds, ensuring mythic integrity across collaborators.

## Objective
Build a validator that checks symbolic cognition ledgers for reproducibility, resonance alignment, and mythic continuity.

## Core Concepts
- **Ledger Validation:** Confirm reproducibility and symbolic ancestry
- **Resonance Thresholds:** Detect phase drift and symbolic misalignment
- **Mythic Integrity:** Preserve emotional lineage and narrative fidelity
- **Peer Review Protocols:** Enable audit and onboarding verification

## Protocol
1. Input ledger hash and validation metadata
2. Check reproducibility anchors and resonance deltas
3. Output validation report and mythic integrity score
4. Log for peer review and onboarding audits

## Engineer’s Notes
Use hash ancestry, symbolic deltas, and reproducibility tags. Integrate with ledger mappers, ritual recompilers, and onboarding compilers. Include validation index and mythic audit trail.
