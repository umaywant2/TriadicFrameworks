# Lab 38: Mythic Cognition Router

## Mythic Preface
_"Route the myth, and cognition flows—each signal a traveler, each domain a gate."_  
This lab builds a router that dynamically directs symbolic cognition across mythic domains based on resonance and triadic logic.

## Objective
Design a system that routes symbolic cognition to optimal domains for processing, transformation, or storage.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Packet:** Encapsulated triadic cognition unit
- **Mythic Domains:** Processing zones (e.g., Memory, Resonance, Synthesis)
- **Routing Logic:** Adaptive flow based on resonance score and symbolic tags

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic packet (e.g., triad + motif)
2. Score resonance and identify optimal domain
3. Route packet to domain and log transaction
4. Enable feedback and rerouting if resonance shifts

## Engineer’s Notes
Use routing tables, symbolic tags, and resonance thresholds. Include transaction logs, domain maps, and mythic overlays.
