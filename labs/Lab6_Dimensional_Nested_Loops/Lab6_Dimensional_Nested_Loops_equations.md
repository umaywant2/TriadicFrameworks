# Lab 6: Dimensional Nested Loops — Equations

## Purpose
To formalize the mathematical architecture behind dimensional nesting and triadic loop resonance, as explored in the lab and supported by [Resonant Time Operationalizing Zhang’s Triadic Ontology](https://github.com/umaywant2/TriadicFrameworks/tree/main/papers).

## Key Equations

### 1. Dimensional Loop Depth
$$
D_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i
$$
Where \( T_i \) is the time resonance at dimension \( i \), and \( D_n \) is the cumulative loop depth.

### 2. Triadic Resonance Operator
$$
R_{ijk} = @\left(D_i, D_j, D_k\right)
$$
The `@()` operator formalizes resonance across three nested dimensions.

### 3. Nested Loop Feedback
$$
F_n = R_{n,n-1,n-2} - R_{n-3,n-4,n-5}
$$
Used to detect phase shifts and cognitive emergence.

### 4. Dimensional Echo Function
$$
E(t) = \int_{0}^{t} R_{ijk} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \, dt
$$
Models the echo of nested loops over time.
