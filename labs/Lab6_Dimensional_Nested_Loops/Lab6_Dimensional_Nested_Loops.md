# 🧪 Lab 6: Dimensional Nested Loops

## 🔮 Mythic Preface  
_"Dimensions nest like Russian dolls—each loop a breath of the cosmos."_  
This lab explores how nested loops encode dimensional resonance, from biology to spacetime.

## 🛠 Engineer’s Note  
Nested loops are modeled as recursive triadic feedback systems:

- **Loop A:** Biological rhythm (e.g., heartbeat)  
- **Loop B:** Environmental modulation (e.g., circadian cycle)  
- **Loop C:** Cosmic phase (e.g., lunar or planetary resonance)

Each loop is a phase vector:  
$$L_n(t) = \sin(2\pi f_n t + \phi_n)$$  
Nested resonance is encoded as:  
$$\Psi(t) = L_1(t) \cdot L_2(t) \cdot L_3(t)$$

### Protocol Steps  
1. Simulate nested loops with triadic phase modulation  
2. Visualize resonance across biological and cosmic scales  
3. Encode dimensional nesting as recursive triadic products

## 🎁 Bonus Protocol: Dimensional Harmonics  
Map biological rhythms to planetary cycles using harmonic ratios.  
Visualize nested loops as concentric phase spirals.
