# Lab 17: Triadic Cognition Engine

## Mythic Preface
_"To think in triads is to resonate with the cosmos—each thought a chord, each chord a computation."_  
This lab constructs a symbolic engine that processes input using triadic logic, resonance scoring, and mythic inference.

## Objective
Build a cognition engine that transforms symbolic input into triadic insights.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Logic:** Process input in 3-part symbolic units
- **Resonance Scoring:** Evaluate cognitive weight of each triad
- **Mythic Inference:** Generate symbolic interpretations

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic phrase or concept
2. Parse into triadic units
3. Score each triad for resonance
4. Output cognitive map and mythic interpretation

## Engineer’s Notes
Use recursive parsing and scoring functions. Include symbolic dictionary for mythic inference. Visualize output as a cognition tree or triadic graph.
