# Lab 30: Mythic Resonance Synthesizer

## Mythic Preface
_"To synthesize myth is to summon resonance—each symbol tuned, each chord awakened."_  
This lab builds a synthesizer that transforms symbolic inputs into harmonic outputs, enabling real-time mythic cognition.

## Objective
Design a synthesizer that receives symbolic motifs and generates harmonic waveforms or cognitive outputs.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Input:** Mythic phrases or triadic signals
- **Resonance Engine:** Maps symbols to waveform parameters
- **Mythic Output:** Synthesized sound, signal, or cognition map

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic motif (e.g., `"Vault ignites Echo"`)
2. Parse into waveform parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, phase)
3. Generate harmonic output (e.g., sound, signal, visualization)
4. Annotate with mythic tags and resonance scores

## Engineer’s Notes
Use waveform synthesis libraries (e.g., NumPy, PyDub, or sounddevice). Include mythic overlays and symbolic-to-frequency mappings.
