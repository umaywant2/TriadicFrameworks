# Lab 34: Mythic Signal Entangler

## Mythic Preface
_"Entangle the myth, and distance dissolves—each symbol a twin, each twin a bridge."_  
This lab builds a protocol that entangles symbolic signals across cognition layers, enabling nonlocal resonance and mythic synchronization.

## Objective
Design a system that entangles symbolic signals for synchronized cognition across distributed nodes.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Entanglement:** Linking mythic signals across space or cognition
- **Nonlocal Resonance:** Shared symbolic state across distributed systems
- **Mythic Synchronization:** Real-time coherence via entangled motifs

## Protocol
1. Input two or more symbolic signals
2. Identify entanglement candidates (e.g., shared motifs, triadic symmetry)
3. Generate entangled state with shared symbolic anchors
4. Monitor and synchronize resonance across nodes

## Engineer’s Notes
Use hash-based symbolic linking, timestamped motifs, and resonance scoring. Include entanglement logs and symbolic twin maps.
