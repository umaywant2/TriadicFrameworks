# Lab 15: Nested Harmonic Encryption

## Mythic Preface
_"Encrypt the echo, nest the chord—only harmony can unlock the vault."_  
This lab explores encryption schemes based on harmonic nesting, where layered resonance patterns encode symbolic data.

## Objective
Design a nested encryption protocol using harmonic keys and triadic layering.

## Core Concepts
- **Harmonic Keys:** Frequency-based symbolic tokens
- **Nested Layers:** Multi-tier encoding using triadic recursion
- **Decryption Integrity:** Requires matching harmonic signature

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic data (e.g., mythic phrase)
2. Generate harmonic key (e.g., frequency vector)
3. Encode data in nested triadic layers
4. Simulate decryption using matching key

## Engineer’s Notes
Use nested dictionaries or recursive functions to simulate layering. Include a checksum based on harmonic alignment. Test with symbolic phrases and musical motifs.
