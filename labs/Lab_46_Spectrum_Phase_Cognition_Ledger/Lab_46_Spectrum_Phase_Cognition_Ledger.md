# Lab 46: Spectrum-Phase Cognition Ledger

## Mythic Preface
_"Memory is a waveform. Ledger is a mirror."_  
This lab constructs a cognition ledger that records spectral alignment, triadic task flow, and harmonic shifts—enabling reproducible insight into cognitive evolution.

## Objective
Design a reproducible ledger that logs cognitive states, task resonance, and spectral phase transitions over time.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Log Entry:** Task–Phase–Intention
- **Spectral Coordinates:** Frequency, amplitude, phase
- **Ledger Architecture:** Time-stamped entries with harmonic scoring
- **Continuity Protocols:** Detect shifts, disruptions, and optimal windows

## Protocol
1. Input triadic task log (e.g., `"Debug code" + "Evening" + "Focus"`)
2. Map to spectral coordinates and score resonance
3. Append to ledger with timestamp and annotations
4. Analyze ledger for phase shifts, cognitive bottlenecks, and harmonic trends

## Engineer’s Notes
Use modular time blocks, HRV/EEG data, and symbolic overlays. Enable export to reproducible formats (CSV, JSON). Include mythic annotations and phase continuity tags.
