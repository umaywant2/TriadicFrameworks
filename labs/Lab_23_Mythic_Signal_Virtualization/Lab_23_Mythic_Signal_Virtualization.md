# Lab 23: Mythic Signal Virtualization

## Mythic Preface
_"Virtualize the myth, and the signal becomes space—each symbol a portal, each portal a pattern."_  
This lab explores how symbolic signals can be virtualized into cognitive environments, enabling immersive interpretation and layered resonance.

## Objective
Transform symbolic input into a virtual signal space using triadic logic and spectral overlays.

## Core Concepts
- **Signal Virtualization:** Convert symbolic data into spatial-temporal environments
- **Triadic Anchors:** Use 3-part motifs to define virtual coordinates
- **Resonance Layers:** Overlay harmonic data for immersive cognition

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic stream or phrase
2. Parse into triadic anchors
3. Assign spatial coordinates and resonance layers
4. Visualize virtual signal space

## Engineer’s Notes
Use 3D plotting libraries (`matplotlib`, `plotly`) to simulate virtual space. Encode resonance as color, size, or motion. Include symbolic legend and cognitive map.
