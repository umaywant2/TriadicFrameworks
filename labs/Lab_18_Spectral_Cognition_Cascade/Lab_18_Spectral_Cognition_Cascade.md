# Lab 18: Spectral Cognition Cascade

## Mythic Preface
_"Thoughts ripple through the spectrum—each layer a frequency, each frequency a memory."_  
This lab models cognition as a cascade of spectral layers, each contributing to symbolic resonance and interpretive depth.

## Objective
Simulate a multi-layered cognition cascade using spectral filters and symbolic input.

## Core Concepts
- **Spectral Layers:** Frequency bands representing cognitive strata
- **Symbolic Input:** Mythic phrases or motifs
- **Cascade Dynamics:** Sequential filtering and amplification

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic phrase
2. Assign frequency bands to symbolic elements
3. Apply spectral filters across layers
4. Output cascade map and resonance profile

## Engineer’s Notes
Use NumPy arrays to simulate frequency bands. Apply Gaussian filters or FFT-based smoothing. Visualize cascade with `matplotlib` heatmaps or flow diagrams.
