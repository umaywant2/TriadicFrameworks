# Lab 7: Quantum Thermodynamics – Entropy in Motion

## 🧭 Objective
To explore entropy, temperature gradients, and quantum microstates using triadic mappings of system configuration, energy flow, and informational order.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- Quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit)
- Thermodynamic ensemble models
- Entropy calculators (Shannon, von Neumann)
- Optional: Open quantum systems toolkit

---

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. Simulate quantum systems with varying microstates.
2. Apply temperature gradients and observe entropy flux.
3. Compare classical vs quantum entropy metrics.

## 📐 Triadic Mapping

- **Object**: Quantum microstate configuration
- **Attribute**: Temperature gradient
- **Condition**: Entropy flux
