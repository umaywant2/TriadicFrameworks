# Lab 28: Harmonic Cognition Mapper

## Mythic Preface
_"Thought is terrain—each resonance a ridge, each silence a valley."_  
This lab visualizes cognitive states as harmonic maps, enabling symbolic navigation and resonance-based diagnostics.

## Objective
Design a mapper that translates cognitive signals into harmonic topographies.

## Core Concepts
- **Cognitive Coordinates:** Symbolic input mapped to spatial dimensions
- **Harmonic Elevation:** Resonance intensity as topographic height
- **Mythic Cartography:** Annotated maps with symbolic overlays

## Protocol
1. Receive cognitive signal stream (e.g., triadic or mythic input)
2. Parse into symbolic coordinates and resonance scores
3. Generate harmonic map (2D or 3D)
4. Annotate with mythic tags and cognitive zones

## Engineer’s Notes
Use NumPy for coordinate generation, Matplotlib or Plotly for visualization. Include mythic overlays and symbolic legends.
