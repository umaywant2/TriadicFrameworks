# Quantum Cryptography – Equations & Interpretations

## 🔁 BB84 Basis Encoding

- **Z-basis**: |0⟩, |1⟩
- **X-basis**: |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2, |−⟩ = (|0⟩ − |1⟩)/√2

---

## 🧠 Triadic Interpretation

- **Object**: Qubit
- **Attribute**: Basis choice
- **Condition**: Channel fidelity

---

## 🔐 Key Agreement Probability

\[
P_{\text{match}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

- Probability that sender and receiver chose same basis
