# Lab 5: Quantum Cryptography – Keys from the Void

## 🧭 Objective
To demonstrate quantum key distribution (QKD) using BB84 protocol and triadic mapping of qubit states, measurement bases, and transmission conditions.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- Quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit)
- Classical channel (simulated or real)
- QKD protocol implementation
- Optional: IBM Quantum backend

---

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. Generate random qubit states using BB84 encoding.
2. Transmit qubits and measure in random bases.
3. Compare sender and receiver bases to extract shared key.
4. Detect eavesdropping via error rate analysis.

## 📐 Triadic Mapping

- **Object**: Qubit state
- **Attribute**: Measurement basis
- **Condition**: Transmission integrity
