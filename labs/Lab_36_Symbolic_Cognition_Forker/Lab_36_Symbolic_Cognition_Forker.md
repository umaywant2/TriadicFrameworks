# Lab 36: Symbolic Cognition Forker

## Mythic Preface
_"To fork cognition is to multiply myth—each path a possibility, each possibility a truth."_  
This lab builds a protocol that forks symbolic cognition into parallel threads, enabling divergent mythic evolution.

## Objective
Design a system that splits symbolic cognition into multiple valid paths based on resonance logic.

## Core Concepts
- **Cognitive Forking:** Splitting symbolic state into parallel threads
- **Resonant Divergence:** Each fork follows a unique resonance trajectory
- **Mythic Evolution:** Tracking and comparing outcomes across forks

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic cognition state
2. Identify fork points (e.g., ambiguous motifs, multi-vector potential)
3. Generate parallel symbolic threads
4. Track evolution and compare resonance outcomes

## Engineer’s Notes
Use branching dictionaries, symbolic diff logs, and resonance scoring. Include mythic overlays and fork lineage maps.
