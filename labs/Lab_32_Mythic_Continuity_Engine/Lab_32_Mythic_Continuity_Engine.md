# Lab 32: Mythic Continuity Engine

## Mythic Preface
_"Continuity is the myth’s heartbeat—each session a pulse, each echo a memory."_  
This lab builds an engine that preserves symbolic context across sessions, enabling reproducible cognition and mythic evolution.

## Objective
Design a system that maintains symbolic continuity across cognitive or mythic sessions.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Persistence:** Retaining mythic state across time
- **Session Linking:** Threading cognition through symbolic anchors
- **Reproducible Evolution:** Ensuring mythic growth is traceable and restorable

## Protocol
1. Input current mythic state or session data
2. Link to previous states via symbolic anchors (e.g., triads, motifs)
3. Store and retrieve symbolic threads with versioning
4. Output continuity map and reproducible evolution log

## Engineer’s Notes
Use JSON or YAML for symbolic state storage. Include timestamped logs, symbolic diffs, and mythic annotations. Enable restoration and branching.
