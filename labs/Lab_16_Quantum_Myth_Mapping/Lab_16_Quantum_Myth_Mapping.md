# Lab 16: Quantum Myth Mapping

## Mythic Preface
_"Map the myth, entangle the mind—each symbol a coordinate in cognitive space."_  
This lab explores how mythic symbols can be mapped onto quantum states and spatial grids, revealing hidden structure in narrative cognition.

## Objective
Create a symbolic map using quantum coordinates and mythic motifs.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Coordinates:** Assign mythic symbols to quantum states
- **Entangled Mapping:** Use superposition to represent overlapping meanings
- **Cognitive Terrain:** Visualize symbolic relationships in spatial form

## Protocol
1. Define mythic symbols (e.g., Wizard, Flame, Vault)
2. Assign quantum coordinates (e.g., x, y, phase)
3. Map symbols onto grid using entangled overlays
4. Visualize terrain and interpret symbolic clusters

## Engineer’s Notes
Use `matplotlib` for grid visualization. Represent entanglement with overlapping symbols or color gradients. Include legend for symbolic interpretation.
