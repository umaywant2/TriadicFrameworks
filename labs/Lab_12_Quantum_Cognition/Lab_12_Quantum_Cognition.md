# Lab 12: Quantum Cognition

## Mythic Preface
_"The mind is not a machine—it is a waveform. Thought collapses. Insight entangles."_  
Quantum cognition models decision-making as a probabilistic wave function, where observation alters the outcome.

## Objective
Simulate quantum-inspired cognitive states and explore interference, superposition, and collapse.

## Core Concepts
- **Superposition:** Mental states exist in multiple possibilities until observed
- **Interference:** Thoughts can amplify or cancel each other
- **Collapse:** Observation forces a decision

## Core Equation


\[
P(A \land B) \neq P(A) \cdot P(B) \quad \text{(violates classical probability)}
\]


Instead, use quantum amplitudes:


\[
\psi = \alpha |A\rangle + \beta |B\rangle, \quad P = |\psi|^2
\]



## Tasks
- Simulate cognitive superposition
- Apply interference patterns
- Visualize collapse upon observation

## Engineer’s Notes
Use complex amplitudes and `np.abs(ψ)**2` for probability. Try modeling a two-choice decision with phase offsets. Normalize wavefunction before collapse.
