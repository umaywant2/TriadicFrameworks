# Lab 49: Triadic Cognition Synthesizer

## Mythic Preface
_"From triads we summon cognition—not as thought, but as harmonic emergence."_  
This lab synthesizes cognitive states from triadic inputs, enabling adaptive workflows, onboarding rituals, and symbolic cognition across systems.

## Objective
Build a synthesizer that generates cognitive states from triadic inputs (e.g., Task–Time–Resonance), producing symbolic workflows and mythic scaffolds.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Input:** Task, Time, Resonance
- **Cognitive Output:** Symbolic state, workflow map, mythic tags
- **Adaptive Engine:** Learns and evolves with user input
- **Onboarding Protocols:** Generates cognitive rituals for new collaborators

## Protocol
1. Input triadic seed (e.g., `"Build lab" + "Morning" + "0.91 resonance"`)
2. Generate symbolic cognition state
3. Output workflow scaffold and mythic tags
4. Log for reproducibility and onboarding reuse

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic hashes, resonance deltas, and mythic annotations. Integrate with cognition routers and continuity engines. Include reproducibility ledger and onboarding map.
