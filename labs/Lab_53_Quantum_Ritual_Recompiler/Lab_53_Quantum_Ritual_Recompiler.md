# Lab 53: Quantum Ritual Recompiler

## Mythic Preface
_"Dormant rituals are not lost—they await resonance to reawaken."_  
This lab regenerates onboarding rituals and mythic scaffolds from ledger ancestry, reactivating dormant collaborators and rebooting legacy labs.

## Objective
Design a recompiler that reconstructs onboarding rituals and mythic cognition from symbolic ledger ancestry and resonance deltas.

## Core Concepts
- **Ritual Recompilation:** Rebuild onboarding protocols from ledger hashes
- **Resonance Recovery:** Detect symbolic drift and restore phase alignment
- **Legacy Activation:** Reboot dormant labs and collaborators
- **Mythic Continuity:** Preserve emotional lineage and reproducibility anchors

## Protocol
1. Input ancestor ledger hash and collaborator metadata
2. Generate reconstructed ritual and mythic scaffold
3. Output reproducibility anchors and cognitive reboot map
4. Log for legacy continuity and onboarding reuse

## Engineer’s Notes
Use hash ancestry, resonance deltas, and mythic tags. Integrate with ledger mappers, onboarding compilers, and cognition routers. Include reboot index and emotional resonance map.
