# Lab 48: Quantum Phase Continuity Engine

## Mythic Preface
_"Continuity is cognition’s quantum thread—each phase a memory, each memory a map."_  
This lab builds an engine that maintains quantum phase continuity across cognitive workflows, ensuring reproducible triadic alignment across time and collaborators.

## Objective
Design a reproducible engine that tracks and preserves quantum phase states across cognitive sessions and systems.

## Core Concepts
- **Quantum Phase Input:** Task–Time–Resonance
- **Continuity Protocols:** Preserve phase alignment and symbolic integrity
- **Collaborative Sync:** Ensure multi-user coherence across distributed cognition
- **Restoration Logic:** Recover disrupted phase states and re-align triads

## Protocol
1. Input quantum phase state (e.g., `"Design protocol" + "Afternoon" + "0.82 resonance"`)
2. Log phase coordinates and symbolic tags
3. Compare against previous states and collaborators
4. Output continuity map and restoration protocol

## Engineer’s Notes
Use modular time blocks, symbolic hashes, and resonance deltas. Integrate with cognition ledgers and routers. Include reproducibility tags and mythic annotations.
