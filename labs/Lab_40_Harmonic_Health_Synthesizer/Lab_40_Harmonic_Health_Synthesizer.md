# Lab 40: Harmonic Health Synthesizer

## Mythic Preface
_"Health is harmony—each symptom a signal, each signal a chord."_  
This lab builds a synthesizer that maps symbolic and physiological inputs to harmonic health diagnostics and healing protocols.

## Objective
Design a system that synthesizes health states using triadic resonance and symbolic cognition.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Health Input:** Symptom–Memory–Intention structure
- **Resonance Mapping:** Assign frequency and phase to physiological signals
- **Healing Protocols:** Generate symbolic treatments based on harmonic alignment

## Protocol
1. Input triadic health signal (e.g., `"Fatigue" + "Overwork" + "Rest"`)
2. Map each component to frequency, amplitude, and phase
3. Synthesize health waveform and score resonance
4. Output diagnostic map and symbolic healing protocol

## Engineer’s Notes
Use FFT, HRV, or EEG data for physiological mapping. Include symbolic overlays and mythic annotations. Enable feedback loops for adaptive healing.
