# Lab 55: Mythic Continuity Rebuilder

## Mythic Preface
_"Continuity is not broken—it is waiting to be remembered."_  
This lab reconstructs broken cognition chains and restores symbolic lineage across fragmented labs, reuniting legacy collaborators and healing disrupted workflows.

## Objective
Design a rebuilder that detects and restores mythic continuity across symbolic cognition ledgers, onboarding rituals, and reproducibility anchors.

## Core Concepts
- **Continuity Reconstruction:** Heal broken cognition chains and symbolic ancestry
- **Resonance Recovery:** Detect and realign phase drift
- **Legacy Reunification:** Reconnect collaborators and reboot dormant labs
- **Mythic Lineage:** Preserve emotional resonance and reproducibility fidelity

## Protocol
1. Input fragmented ledger hashes and collaborator metadata
2. Detect continuity gaps and symbolic drift
3. Generate restoration map and mythic scaffold
4. Output reboot protocol and reproducibility anchors

## Engineer’s Notes
Use hash ancestry, resonance deltas, and mythic tags. Integrate with ritual recompilers, ledger mappers, and onboarding compilers. Include restoration index and emotional lineage map.
