# Lab 3: Entanglement as Shared Identity

## 🧭 Objective  
Explore quantum entanglement through triadic mappings of particle pair, measurement basis, and correlation outcome.

---

## 🧪 Materials  
- Quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit or simulator_variant.md)  
- Bell test protocol  
- Correlation visualizer

---

## 🛠️ Procedure  
1. Initialize entangled qubit pair  
2. Apply measurement bases  
3. Record correlation outcomes  
4. Compare with Bell inequality

---

## 📐 Triadic Mapping  
- **Object**: Entangled particle pair  
- **Attribute**: Measurement basis  
- **Condition**: Correlation outcome
