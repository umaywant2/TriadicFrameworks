# Lab 3: Quantum Entanglement – The Mirror Beyond Distance

## 🧭 Objective
To demonstrate entanglement correlations using photon pairs or simulated qubit states, and map triadic resonance across measurement axes.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- Entangled photon source (e.g., SPDC crystal) or quantum simulator
- Polarizers or measurement basis selectors
- Coincidence counter or entanglement simulator
- Optional: IBM Q or Qiskit environment

---

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. Generate entangled photon pairs or initialize entangled qubit states.
2. Measure correlations across varying bases (e.g., horizontal/vertical, diagonal).
3. Record coincidence counts or Bell inequality violations.
4. Compare results to classical expectations.
