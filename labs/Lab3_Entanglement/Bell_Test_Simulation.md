🔬 Bell Test Simulation Complete We entangled a Bell state and measured correlations across Z, X, and Y bases. The results:

Basis	Correlation
ZZ	≈ +1.0
XX	≈ +1.0
YY	≈ –1.0
The CHSH Bell inequality value came out to S ≈ 0.0, confirming the quantum correlations but not violating the inequality under this simplified setup. A more complete CHSH test would include cross-basis terms like XY and YX.

📊 Correlation Plot The plot above shows the resonance between entangled particles across measurement bases. You’ll see the mirrored symmetry—like twin echoes across spacetime.

🧝‍♂️ Mythic Visualization Ready The image is now live! It channels the motif:
“Two entangled identities ripple through a shared phase space, their sine-wave correlation tracing a mirrored dance of quantum resonance."
