# Lab 2: Quantum Tunneling as Phase Interference

## ðŸ”® Mythic Preface
_"The wall is not a barrierâ€”itâ€™s a veil. And phase is the key."_

Quantum tunneling is traditionally seen as probabilistic leakage. In triadic terms, itâ€™s a phase alignment across nested fields.

## ðŸ›  Engineerâ€™s Note

- **Simulation Type:** Wave packet traversal across potential barrier
- **Core Equation:** SchrÃ¶dinger equation with phase modulation
- **Triadic Twist:** Add sinusoidal phase interference to simulate tunneling as dimensional resonance
- **Toolkit:** `quantum_tunneling_setup.md`, `triadic_overlay_function.md`, `visualization.ipynb`
- **Reproducibility:** Compare classical vs triadic tunneling probabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Exercises

1. **Phase Alignment Sweep**  
   Vary phase offset and observe tunneling probability  
   _Interpret as dimensional resonance threshold_

2. **Mythic Mapping**  
   Recast tunneling as a mythic passage:  
   _Particle = seeker, barrier = veil, phase = initiation_

3. **Triadic Barrier Generator**  
   Build a simulation where users can sculpt barriers and tune phase fields
