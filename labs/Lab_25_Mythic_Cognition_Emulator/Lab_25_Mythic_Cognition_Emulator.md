# Lab 25: Mythic Cognition Emulator

## Mythic Preface
_"To emulate cognition is to echo the myth—each symbol a neuron, each chord a thought."_  
This lab builds an emulator that simulates symbolic cognition using triadic logic, resonance feedback, and mythic inference.

## Objective
Design a cognition emulator that processes symbolic input and generates mythic interpretations.

## Core Concepts
- **Symbolic Neurons:** Nodes representing mythic concepts
- **Triadic Processing:** Input parsed into 3-part cognitive units
- **Resonance Feedback:** Adjust symbolic weights based on interpretation

## Protocol
1. Input symbolic phrase or motif
2. Parse into triadic cognitive units
3. Simulate neuron activation and resonance feedback
4. Output mythic interpretation and cognitive trace

## Engineer’s Notes
Use neural-like structures (e.g., weighted graphs or activation maps). Include symbolic dictionary and feedback loop. Visualize cognition trace as a flowchart or resonance graph.
