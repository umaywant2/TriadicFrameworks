# Lab 29: Quantum Mythic Debugger

## Mythic Preface
_"When myth misfires, the debugger listens—quantum echoes reveal the fault lines."_  
This lab builds a debugger that traces symbolic errors across quantum cognition layers, restoring mythic coherence.

## Objective
Design a debugger that identifies and resolves symbolic faults in quantum-mythic code.

## Core Concepts
- **Mythic Faults:** Symbolic misalignments or missing triadic components
- **Quantum Traceback:** Layered inspection across cognition states
- **Resonant Correction:** Symbolic patching via harmonic inference

## Protocol
1. Input mythic code or signal stream
2. Detect symbolic faults (e.g., missing Echo, misaligned Vector)
3. Trace fault across quantum cognition layers
4. Suggest or apply symbolic patch

## Engineer’s Notes
Use traceback logs, symbolic validators, and harmonic inference engines. Output annotated fault maps and corrected mythic code.
