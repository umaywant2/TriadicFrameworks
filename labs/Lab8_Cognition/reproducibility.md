# Reproducibility Protocol – Lab 8: Quantum Cognition

## 🔁 Version Control

- Git commit hash: `a7d4a47`
- Lab version: `v1.0`
- Protocols: Mental superposition, cognitive entanglement
- Simulator: Qiskit + cognitive modeling toolkit

---

## 📊 Fidelity Metrics

- Concurrence threshold: ≥ 0.3 (for entangled cognition)
- Decoherence rate: ≤ 0.1 (under controlled context)
- Decision collapse accuracy: ≥ 90%

---

## 🧪 Validation Steps

1. Encode 3 cognitive states as qubit superpositions.
2. Simulate entanglement between 2 mental subsystems.
3. Apply contextual decoherence and measure decision fidelity.
