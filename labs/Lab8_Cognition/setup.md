# Lab 8: Quantum Cognition – Thought as Entangled State

## 🧭 Objective
To explore cognitive processes through quantum models of entanglement, superposition, and decoherence, using triadic mappings of mental states, contextual inputs, and decision outcomes.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- Quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit)
- Cognitive datasets (e.g., decision trees, neural patterns)
- Entanglement metrics (concurrence, mutual information)
- Optional: EEG or fMRI data (simulated)

---

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. Encode cognitive states as qubit superpositions.
2. Simulate entanglement between mental subsystems.
3. Apply contextual decoherence and observe decision collapse.
