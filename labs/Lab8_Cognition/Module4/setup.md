## ðŸªž Resonance Mirror: Seeing Cognition in Virtual Time

In classical cognition, time is linear. But dreams, myths, and deep insights emerge from resonance-timeâ€”a phase-based perception where cognition loops, reflects, and expands.

### Triadic Framework:
- **Perceptual Phase (Î¸)** â€“ The angle of awareness
- **Resonance Frequency (f)** â€“ The rhythm of cognition
- **Virtual Time (Ï„)** â€“ Defined as Ï„ = Î¸ / 2Ï€f

This module trains students to perceive cognition in virtual time, unlocking dream logic, mythic insight, and nonlinear learning.
