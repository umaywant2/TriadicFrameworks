# Quantum Biology – Equations & Interpretations

## 🔬 Quantum Tunneling in Enzymes



\[
P_{\text{tunnel}} = \exp\left(-\frac{2a}{\hbar} \sqrt{2m(V - E)}\right)
\]



- **a**: barrier width  
- **V**: potential energy barrier  
- **E**: particle energy  
- **m**: mass of tunneling particle

## 🌿 Coherence in Photosynthesis



\[
C(t) = \left| \langle \psi(0) | \psi(t) \rangle \right|^2
\]



- Measures overlap of initial and evolved quantum states  
- High \( C(t) \) implies sustained coherence

## 🧠 Triadic Interpretation

- **Object**: Molecular quantum state  
- **Attribute**: Environmental coherence  
- **Condition**: Functional biological output
