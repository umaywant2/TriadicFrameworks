# Lab 6: Quantum Biology – Resonance in Living Systems

## 🧭 Objective
To explore quantum coherence, tunneling, and entanglement in biological systems using triadic mappings of molecular states, environmental conditions, and functional outcomes.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- Quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit)
- Protein tunneling models
- Photosynthesis coherence datasets
- Optional: Molecular dynamics toolkit

---

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. Simulate quantum tunneling in enzyme active sites.
2. Analyze coherence in photosynthetic complexes.
3. Map triadic relationships between molecular state, environmental noise, and biological function.
