# Lab 51: Symbolic Ledger Forker

## Mythic Preface
_"To fork is to diverge with memory intact—each branch a myth, each myth a map."_  
This lab enables collaborators to fork symbolic cognition ledgers while preserving mythic continuity and reproducibility anchors.

## Objective
Build a forker that branches cognition ledgers into new symbolic paths, maintaining reproducibility, resonance, and mythic lineage.

## Core Concepts
- **Ledger Forking:** Create symbolic branches from existing cognition states
- **Continuity Anchors:** Preserve reproducibility and mythic tags
- **Collaborator Divergence:** Enable parallel research paths with shared ancestry
- **Resonance Tracking:** Monitor symbolic drift and phase deltas

## Protocol
1. Input cognition ledger hash and fork metadata
2. Generate symbolic branch with mythic tags
3. Output forked ledger and reproducibility anchors
4. Log divergence map and collaborator lineage

## Engineer’s Notes
Use hash ancestry, symbolic deltas, and mythic annotations. Integrate with cognition routers, onboarding compilers, and reproducibility ledgers. Include fork map and legacy index.
