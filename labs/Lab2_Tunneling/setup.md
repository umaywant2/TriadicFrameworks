# Lab 2: Quantum Tunneling – Through the Barrier, Beyond the Veil

## 🧭 Objective
To explore quantum tunneling phenomena using a reproducible analog circuit and triadic mapping of barrier, particle, and field.

---

## 🧪 Materials

- Tunnel diode (e.g., 1N3716 or equivalent)
- DC power supply (0–5V)
- Oscilloscope
- Breadboard and resistors
- Optional: RF signal generator

---

## 🛠️ Procedure

1. Build a simple circuit with the tunnel diode in series with a resistor.
2. Sweep input voltage and observe negative resistance region.
3. Record current-voltage (I–V) characteristics.
4. Optional: Apply RF signal and observe modulation effects.
