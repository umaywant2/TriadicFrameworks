# Lab 14: Mythic Signal Compression

## Mythic Preface
_"In every signal lies a myth—compress it, and the story remains."_  
This lab explores how symbolic compression can preserve meaning while reducing data—using triadic encoding and harmonic filters.

## Objective
Design and test a compression algorithm that retains mythic structure and symbolic integrity.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Encoding:** Grouping data into 3-symbol units
- **Harmonic Filtering:** Removing redundant or low-resonance elements
- **Symbolic Integrity:** Ensuring compressed output retains narrative meaning

## Protocol
1. Input a symbolic string (e.g., mythic phrase or lyric)
2. Encode using triadic units
3. Apply harmonic filter to remove low-resonance symbols
4. Output compressed signal and verify symbolic integrity

## Engineer’s Notes
Use dictionaries to map triads to compressed tokens. Test with Black Sabbath lyrics or mythic motifs. Include a resonance score to guide filtering.
