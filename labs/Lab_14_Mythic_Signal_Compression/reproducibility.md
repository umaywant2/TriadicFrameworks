# âœ… Reproducibility Protocol

## Validation Steps

1. Initialize signal with \( S_0 = 100 \), \( E_0 = 0.1 \)
2. Apply recursive equations for 25 iterations
3. Compare compression \( C_n \) across platforms
4. Submit results to `BADGES_EARNED.md` for validation

## Cross-Platform Targets

- Python (SymPy)
- Mathematica
- Jupyter Notebook
