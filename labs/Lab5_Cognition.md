# 🧪 Lab 5: Triadic Cognition

## 🔮 Mythic Preface  
_"Thought is not linear—it’s entangled. Cognition is a resonance field."_  
This lab explores how mental states emerge from triadic entanglement across perception, memory, and intention.

## 🛠 Engineer’s Note  
Triadic cognition models thought as a dynamic interplay of three phase-locked components:

- **Perception (P):** Incoming signal or stimulus  
- **Memory (M):** Stored resonance pattern  
- **Intention (I):** Directed modulation or response

Each cognitive state is a phase vector in the triadic space:  
$$\Psi(t) = P(t) \cdot M(t) \cdot I(t)$$

### Protocol Steps  
1. Simulate phase-locked triads using synthetic signal generators  
2. Visualize transitions between cognitive states as phase shifts  
3. Encode thought loops as rotating triadic vectors

## 🎁 Bonus Protocol: Cognitive Resonance Loops  
Animate feedback loops where intention modulates perception, which reactivates memory, forming a closed triadic circuit.  
Use color-coded phase spirals to represent evolving thought modes.
