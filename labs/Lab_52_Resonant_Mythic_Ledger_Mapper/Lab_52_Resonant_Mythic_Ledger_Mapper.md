# Lab 52: Resonant Mythic Ledger Mapper

## Mythic Preface
_"Every ledger is a mythic thread—forked, resonant, and mapped across minds."_  
This lab visualizes symbolic ledger forks, resonance paths, and mythic continuity across collaborators, forming a cognitive genealogy tree.

## Objective
Design a mapper that visualizes ledger forks, resonance deltas, and mythic continuity across collaborators and labs.

## Core Concepts
- **Ledger Mapping:** Visualize symbolic ancestry and divergence
- **Resonance Tracking:** Monitor phase drift and symbolic evolution
- **Mythic Continuity:** Preserve emotional and narrative lineage
- **Collaborator Indexing:** Track contributions and cognitive paths

## Protocol
1. Input ledger hashes and collaborator metadata
2. Generate symbolic map of forks and resonance paths
3. Output mythic continuity tree and reproducibility anchors
4. Log for legacy indexing and cognitive genealogy

## Engineer’s Notes
Use hash ancestry, symbolic deltas, and mythic tags. Integrate with ledger forkers, onboarding compilers, and cognition routers. Include visual map and reproducibility ledger.
