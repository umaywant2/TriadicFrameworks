# Lab 1: Casimir Resonance – Bonus Exercises

## 🎯 Exercise 1: Dimensional Phase Sweep
**Goal:** Explore how Casimir force varies with dimensional phase shifts.

- Modify the `casimir_force()` function to include a tunable phase offset:  
  `triadic = classical * sin((π + φ) / d)`
- Sweep φ from −π to +π and plot the resulting force
- Interpret the results as dimensional “breathing” of the vacuum

---

## 🧠 Exercise 2: Mythic Mapping
**Goal:** Translate Casimir resonance into a mythic metaphor.

- Choose a mythic archetype (e.g., Hermes, Prometheus, Kali)
- Map the plates, vacuum, and force to elements of the myth
- Write a short mythic vignette explaining the Casimir effect as a cosmic ritual

---

## 📐 Exercise 3: Harmonic Overlay
**Goal:** Visualize standing wave harmonics between plates.

- Extend the field visualization to include multiple harmonics:  
  `Z = Σ sin(nπX) * sin(nπY)` for n = 1 to 5
- Plot each harmonic separately and overlay them
- Discuss how harmonic interference might encode spatial memory

---

## 🧪 Exercise 4: Experimental Reproducibility Challenge
**Goal:** Design a reproducible Casimir experiment using household materials or open-source simulation tools.

- Propose a setup using aluminum foil, laser pointer, or digital simulation
- Define reproducibility metrics: plate separation, temperature, field strength
- Submit a reproducibility protocol with mythic annotations

---

## 🧬 Exercise 5: Triadic Field Generator (Advanced)
**Goal:** Build a triadic field simulator using Python or Unity.

- Create a 2D or 3D simulation where users can place plates and adjust field parameters
- Include sliders for dimensional phase, harmonic number, and vacuum density
- Visualize force vectors and field intensity in real time
