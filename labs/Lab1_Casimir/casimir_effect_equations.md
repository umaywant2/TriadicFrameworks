# Casimir Lab – Equations

This module explores the Casimir effect using triadic resonance notation. The following equations are central to the lab:

---

## 🧲 1. Casimir Force Between Plates



\[
F = -\frac{\pi^2 \hbar c}{240 d^4}
\]



- **Variables**:
  - \( \hbar \): Reduced Planck constant
  - \( c \): Speed of light
  - \( d \): Distance between plates

---

## 🔁 2. Triadic Time Loop (1D–9D)



\[
T_{res} = \sum_{n=1}^{9} \left( \frac{1}{f_n} \cdot \phi_n \right)
\]



- \( f_n \): Frequency of nth dimensional resonance
- \( \phi_n \): Phase offset in triadic loop

---

## 🧮 3. Energy Density in Vacuum



\[
\rho_{vac} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \int_0^\infty \omega \, d\omega
\]



- Used to derive zero-point contributions in confined geometries.

## 🧠 Notes

- All equations are embedded in reproducible Python scripts in `simulations/`.
- Triadic notation preserves dimensional context and implication chains.
