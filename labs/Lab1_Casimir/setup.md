# Lab 1: Casimir Resonance

## 🧭 Objective  
Explore vacuum pressure as a triadic resonance field, using Casimir forces to reveal standing wave interference between boundaries.

---

## 🧪 Materials  
- Quantum simulator (optional)  
- Casimir force calculator  
- Visualization toolkit (e.g., matplotlib)

---

## 🛠️ Procedure  
1. Define boundary conditions (plate separation)  
2. Compute Casimir force using triadic interpretation  
3. Visualize force vs separation  
4. Interpret vacuum fluctuations as phase interference

## 📐 Triadic Mapping  
- **Object**: Vacuum mode configuration  
- **Attribute**: Boundary separation  
- **Condition**: Emergent pressure
