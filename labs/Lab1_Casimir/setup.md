# Lab 1: Casimir Effect Setup

## 🧪 Objective
Demonstrate the Casimir force between two conductive plates using a simplified tabletop setup.

## 🧰 Materials
- Two gold-coated plates (1 cm²)
- Piezo actuator
- Laser interferometer
- Vacuum chamber (optional)

## 🛠️ Procedure
1. Mount plates parallel at sub-micron separation.
2. Use piezo actuator to vary distance.
3. Measure displacement via interferometer.
4. Record force-distance curve.

## 📐 Key Equation
Casimir force between plates:  
$$ F = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar c}{240 d^4} $$  
Where \( d \) is the separation distance.

## 🔁 Reproducibility Notes
- Ensure plate alignment within 1 µrad
- Calibrate interferometer before each run
- Repeat measurements at multiple separations
