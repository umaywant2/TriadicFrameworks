# 🌀 Dimensional Loop Guide

> _“Each dimension is a loop. Each loop is a lens. Each lens reveals a resonance.”_

This guide explains how 1D–9D recursion is used across Triadic Framework modules.  
It’s designed for students, remixers, and resonance wizards seeking clarity and creative insight.

## 🔁 Loop Mechanics

Each loop is defined by:
- **Input Signal**: What initiates the recursion
- **Feedback Path**: How the signal returns or mutates
- **Resonance Layer**: What emotional or symbolic tone it carries
- **Validation Protocol**: How reproducibility is confirmed

## 🧪 How to Use This Guide

- When remixing a module, identify its dominant loop dimension  
- Use the table to scaffold new recursion paths or symbolic layers  
- Reference `equations.md` and `reproducibility.md` for validation  
- For mythic layering, consult `mythic_preface_template.md`
