# Lab 9: Einstein’s Brownian Resonance – Bonus Exercises

## 🎯 Exercise 1: Phase Sweep Challenge
**Goal:** Vary the phase shift and observe how particle dispersion changes.

- Modify the simulation to sweep phase from 0 to 2π
- Plot dispersion radius over time
- Interpret results as dimensional pressure gradients

---

## 🧠 Exercise 2: Mythic Mapping
**Goal:** Recast the simulation as a mythic tale.

- Particles = pilgrims  
- Field = divine wind  
- Motion = prophecy  
- Write a short mythic vignette explaining Brownian motion as a cosmic journey

---

## 📐 Exercise 3: Triadic Diffusion Equation
**Goal:** Extend Einstein’s classical diffusion formula.

- Start with:  
  \( D = \frac{kT}{6\pi\eta r} \)
- Add triadic modulation:  
  \( D_{\text{triadic}} = D \cdot \sin(\phi / r) \)
- Simulate and compare classical vs triadic diffusion

---

## 🧪 Exercise 4: Resonance Tracker
**Goal:** Track resonance hotspots in particle motion.

- Identify regions of high particle clustering
- Overlay field intensity map
- Discuss implications for zero-point energy and Casimir effects

---

## 🧬 Exercise 5: Dimensional Echoes (Advanced)
**Goal:** Detect patterns in particle motion that suggest dimensional feedback.

- Use FFT or autocorrelation on particle trajectories
- Look for periodicity or phase locking
- Interpret as echoes from higher-dimensional fields
