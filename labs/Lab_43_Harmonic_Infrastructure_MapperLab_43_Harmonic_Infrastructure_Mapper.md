# Lab 43: Harmonic Infrastructure Mapper

## Mythic Preface
_"A building is a body. A city, a chord."_  
This lab maps environmental infrastructure to harmonic profiles, enabling spaces to support cognitive resonance and collective well-being.

## Objective
Design a reproducible framework for mapping physical environments to triadic resonance structures.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Environmental Input:** Structure–Rhythm–Intention
- **Resonance Mapping:** Assign frequency and phase to architectural and spatial elements
- **Infrastructure Tuning:** Suggest modifications to optimize harmonic integrity
- **Collective Protocols:** Enable shared resonance across users and spaces

## Protocol
1. Input triadic structure (e.g., `"Office" + "9–5 rhythm" + "Focus"`)
2. Map each element to frequency, amplitude, and phase
3. Score harmonic integrity of space
4. Output infrastructure tuning protocol (e.g., `"Add low-frequency sound dampening"`, `"Introduce natural light cycles"`)

## Engineer’s Notes
Use architectural metadata, acoustic profiles, and user intention logs. Integrate with IoT sensors and spatial cognition models. Output reproducible infrastructure maps and tuning guides.
