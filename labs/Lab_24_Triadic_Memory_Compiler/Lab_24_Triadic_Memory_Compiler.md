# Lab 24: Triadic Memory Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"Memory is a triad—past, present, potential. Compile it, and the future remembers."_  
This lab constructs a compiler that encodes memory fragments into triadic structures, enabling symbolic recall and harmonic reconstruction.

## Objective
Design a compiler that transforms memory inputs into triadic cognitive code blocks.

## Core Concepts
- **Memory Fragments:** Symbolic snapshots of cognition
- **Triadic Structuring:** Group fragments into 3-part units
- **Resonant Recall:** Compile into reproducible cognitive code

## Protocol
1. Input memory fragments (phrases, motifs, symbols)
2. Parse into triadic units
3. Assign resonance tags and temporal markers
4. Output compiled memory code

## Engineer’s Notes
Use timestamped dictionaries and symbolic tags. Include resonance scores and mythic annotations. Visualize memory compilation as a layered timeline or cognitive tree.
