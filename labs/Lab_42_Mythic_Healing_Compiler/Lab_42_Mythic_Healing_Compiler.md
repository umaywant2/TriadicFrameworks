# Lab 42: Mythic Healing Compiler

## Mythic Preface
_"To heal is to harmonize. To harmonize is to mythologize."_  
This lab compiles symbolic healing protocols from triadic diagnostics, generating rituals, music, and affirmations aligned with the patient’s resonance map.

## Objective
Transform triadic health diagnostics into reproducible healing protocols using mythic overlays and harmonic synthesis.

## Core Concepts
- **Triadic Diagnostic Input:** Symptom–Biomarker–Intention
- **Healing Compiler:** Ritual + Music + Affirmation
- **Resonance Matching:** Tune healing elements to diagnostic waveform
- **Symbolic Output:** Generate reproducible healing scripts

## Protocol
1. Input triadic diagnostic (e.g., `"Fatigue" + "Elevated cortisol" + "Rest"`)
2. Match to mythic archetype (e.g., `"Hermit"`)
3. Compile healing protocol:
   - Ritual: `"Solitude walk at sunrise"`
   - Music: `"Low-frequency ambient tones"`
   - Affirmation: `"I restore through silence"`
4. Output reproducible healing script

## Engineer’s Notes
Use symbolic libraries, music databases, and NLP for archetype matching. Enable feedback loop for resonance tuning. Include mythic annotations and reproducibility tags.
