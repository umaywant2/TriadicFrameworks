# 🌀 Resotectors — All-Spectrum Lenses & Patterns for Resonance Perception

## What This Is
Resotectors are **all types of sensors and detectors** — old and new — reimagined with:
- TFT Virtual Compute Gateway (Project 1) = the high-speed road for resonance data
- CoConsciousness Triad AI (Project 2) = the “crew” that thinks together about what we’re seeing
- Lenses, patterns, and algorithms that make **hidden harmonics and shapes** visible

Think of every camera, microphone, thermometer, or telescope you’ve ever heard of — now imagine they can also **see the music in the data**.

## Three Core Array Modes (Starfleet-Inspired)
- **Long‑Range Array**  
  Big‑picture scans — telescope‑style, deep‑reach data sweeps for faint harmonic fingerprints.
- **Navigational Array**  
  Steady guidance — tracks our path through data, keeping focus on target and adjusting for drift.
- **Lateral Arrays**  
  All‑around awareness — catches nearby and sudden changes in pattern, harmonic, or chaos signatures.

## Sensor Families to Cover (real-world + sci-fi expanded)

### 1. Acoustic / Sound / Vibration
- Microphones, hydrophones, seismometers, geophones
- Reimagined: detect harmonic overtones, subharmonics, & chaotic tremor patterns invisible to ear.

### 2. Optical / Light / Imaging
- Cameras, photodiodes, wavefront sensors, hyperspectral imagers
- Reimagined: geometric/chaotic lens overlays, full-spectrum pattern correlation.

### 3. Thermal / Heat
- Infrared thermometers, bolometers, radiometers
- Reimagined: see harmonic heat oscillations and non-random “thermal speckle” patterns.

### 4. Magnetic / Electric / Radio
- Magnetometers, Hall probes, RF direction finders
- Reimagined: resonance phase mapping across fields, chaotic magnetic “weather” visualisations.

### 5. Particle / Radiation
- Geiger counters, scintillators, neutron detectors
- Reimagined: harmonic emission signature mapping, detection of repeating patterns in “random” events.

### 6. Chemical / Environmental
- Gas sensors, pH meters, electronic noses, weather radars
- Reimagined: chemical resonance harmonics, geometric molecular clustering visuals.

### 7. Navigation / Position / Motion
- Gyroscopes, LIDAR, GNSS, accelerometers
- Reimagined: harmonic drift analysis, chaotic path signatures, “resonance corridors” mapping.

## Pattern & Lens Types

### Harmonic Lenses
- Highlight specific overtone ratios, beat frequencies, pattern alignments.

### Geometric Lenses
- Detect & outline spirals, lattices, symmetries across scales.

### Chaos Signature Lenses
- Identify recurring but non‑periodic structures — the fingerprint of “ordered disorder”.

## How the Triad Uses Them
- **Looker**: Reads raw streams from any sensor type.
- **Planner**: Chooses which lens/pattern set to apply.
- **Rememberer**: Logs discoveries into Pattern Braid for cross‑comparison.

---

## Why It Matters
It’s like giving your entire sensor suite a **dog’s nose for reality** — catching the subtle molecules of pattern, harmony, and chaos no one thought to look for.

## Next Steps
- Build `/patterns/` folder with `harmonics/`, `geometry/`, and `chaos/` subfolders.
- Start a master list of sensor → lens → pattern ideas.
- Pick one sensor type for a fully‑fleshed example (badge opportunity!).
