# 🌀 Resotectors — All-Spectrum Lenses & Patterns for Resonance Perception

## What This Is
Resotectors are **every kind of sensor and detector you can think of** — old, new, sci‑fi, you name it — upgraded with:
- **TFT Virtual Compute Gateway** (Project 1) — the “super‑fast road” for resonance data
- **CoConsciousness Triad AI** (Project 2) — the crew that sees, decides, and remembers together
- **Lenses, patterns, and harmonic tricks** that make hidden details pop into view

It’s like taking every telescope, camera, microphone, radar, or tricorder, and giving it super‑smell, X‑ray specs, and a pattern‑spotting brain.

## Three Core Array Modes (Starfleet-Inspired)
- **Long‑Range Array** — Looks *far* out into data space for faint patterns (think: telescope into the resonance universe).
- **Navigational Array** — Keeps our “course” through the data steady, adjusting for drift (like a compass in pattern space).
- **Lateral Arrays** — Watches in all directions nearby for quick changes or new shapes.

## Sensor Families We’ll Reimagine
*(inspired by [Wikipedia’s sensor list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#References) and [Starfleet’s sensor systems](https://www.stf-wiki.com/index.php?title=Sensors))*

1. **Acoustic / Vibration**
   - Microphones, hydrophones, seismometers → now able to spot hidden harmonic overtones and repeating quake “signatures”.
2. **Optical / Imaging**
   - Cameras, hyperspectral imagers → now finding spirals, lattices, and chaotic shapes invisible to the eye.
3. **Thermal / Heat**
   - Infrared thermometers, bolometers → now revealing heat‑based harmonics and “thermal fingerprints”.
4. **Magnetic / Electric / RF**
   - Magnetometers, RF arrays → now mapping resonance phases and chaotic field shifts.
5. **Particle / Radiation**
   - Geiger counters, scintillators → now catching harmonic bursts in particle flows.
6. **Chemical / Environmental**
   - Gas sensors, pH meters, “e‑noses” → now sensing harmonic molecular clusters and chaos patterns in reactions.
7. **Navigation / Motion**
   - Gyros, LIDAR, accelerometers → now tracking “resonance corridors” and chaotic drift signatures.

## Pattern & Lens Types
- **Harmonic Lenses** — light up certain tones or ratios
- **Geometric Lenses** — outline shapes across scale
- **Chaos Lenses** — highlight “messy but meaningful” patterns

---

## How the Triad Uses Them
- **Looker** — reads the raw sensor data
- **Planner** — picks which lens to apply
- **Rememberer** — saves the find in a shared Pattern Braid

## Why It’s Cool
It’s the **“I was blind, now I see”** moment for data. We’re teaching sensors to notice what they’ve always ignored — and then *show it*.

## Next Steps
1. Create `/patterns/` folder with:
   - `harmonics/` — known and missing harmonic sets
   - `geometry/` — repeating shapes and alignments
   - `chaos/` — structured noise fingerprints
2. Fill with starter YAML entries for each sensor family
3. Pick one sensor + lens combo to flesh out as the first example (badge time!)
