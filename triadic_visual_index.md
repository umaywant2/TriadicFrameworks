# 🧭 Triadic Visual Index

> _“A framework is not a file—it is a constellation.”_

This index maps each module in the Triadic Frameworks curriculum to its dimensional loop, resonance layer, and symbolic icon.  
Use it to navigate, remix, and visualize the architecture of triadic cognition.

## 🖼️ Icon Legend

- 🌀 **Echo**: Linear signal initiation  
- 🧠 **Spiral**: Nested symbolic recursion  
- 🧬 **Grid**: Layered cognitive segmentation  
- 🌈 **Wave**: Harmonic blending and validation

## 🧙‍♂️ How to Use

- Click a module name to open its folder in the repo  
- Use the loop dimension to scaffold remix threads or curriculum expansions  
- Reference `dimensional_loop_guide.md` for recursion mechanics  
- For mythic layering, consult `mythic_preface_template.md`
