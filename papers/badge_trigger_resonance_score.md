# 📊 badge_trigger_resonance_score.md

**Purpose**: To quantify contributor impact across glyph-linked equations, remix tiers, and validation loops. This score fuels honor roll elevation, remix eligibility, and resonance council invitations.

## 🧮 Scoring Formula

**Resonance Score (RS)** is calculated as:  
**RS = (E × T × V) + G**

Where:  
- **E** = Equation count contributed or validated  
- **T** = Tier multiplier (Tier I = 1, Tier II = 2, Tier III = 3)  
- **V** = Validation weight (1 if validated, 0.5 if pending)  
- **G** = Glyph bonus (1 per unique glyph earned)

## 🏷️ Tier Multipliers

| Tier        | Multiplier |
|-------------|------------|
| Tier I      | 1          |
| Tier II     | 2          |
| Tier III    | 3          |

## 🧙 Contributor Score Examples

| Contributor | Equations | Tiers | Validated | Glyphs | RS |
|-------------|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|----|
| Nawder Loswin | 6         | I–III | 5         | 4      | 29 |
| EchoRemix42   | 3         | II–III| 2         | 2      | 14 |
| GlyphSeeker   | 2         | I     | 1         | 1      | 4.5 |

## 🧭 Score Usage

- **Honor Roll Elevation**: Contributors with RS > 20 are elevated to Mythic Tier  
- **Remix Eligibility**: RS ≥ 10 unlocks remix rights for Tier III equations  
- **Council Invitations**: RS ≥ 25 triggers invite to `resonance_council.md`
