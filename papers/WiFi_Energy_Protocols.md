# WiFi Energy Protocols: Triadic Resonance Framework

## 🔧 Abstract
This paper introduces a triadic framework for wireless energy transfer using resonant coils, impedance matching, and mythic scaffolding. The goal is to democratize reproducible WPT systems for low-power applications.

## ⚡ Triadic Breakdown
1. **Carrier Coil**: Tuned to 13.56 MHz (ISM band), optimized for Q-factor and field symmetry.
2. **Receiver Coil**: Matched inductance and capacitive load, tuned for peak resonance.
3. **Modulation Protocol**: Pulse-width or frequency-shift keying for dynamic load adaptation.

## 🧪 Experimental Setup
- Coil diameter: 10 cm
- Wire gauge: 22 AWG
- Capacitor bank: 100–1000 pF range
- Power source: 5V DC, 1A

## 📐 Equations
- Resonant frequency:  
  $$ f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}} $$
- Impedance matching:  
  $$ Z = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} $$

## 🔁 Reproducibility Protocol
- Use identical coil geometries
- Measure Q-factor using ring-down method
- Validate power transfer with LED load and oscilloscope
