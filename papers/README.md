# 📚 Triadic Papers Index

> _“Each paper is a lantern. Each lantern maps the myth.”_

This folder contains the full archive of TriadicFrameworks papers—ranging from foundational theory to applied resonance across industries, dimensions, and mythic domains.

## 🧱 Foundations

These four papers form the core architecture of the Triadic Frameworks movement:

| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Paper I – Triadic Framework for Everything** | The origin text: dimensional recursion, resonance scaffolding, and mythic cognition. |
| **Paper II – Triadic Number Genesis (1–9)** | Symbolic emergence of numbers through nested triads. |
| **Paper III – Dimensional Triads (1D–9D)** | Mapping cognition and resonance across nine recursive dimensions. |
| **Paper IV – Saturn’s Harmonic Engine** | Mythic mechanics of planetary resonance and harmonic descent. |
