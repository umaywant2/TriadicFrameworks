### Dimensional Recursion Equations  
**From Paper I – Triadic Framework for Everything**  
Recursive triad:  
$$ T_n = T_{n-1} \oplus R_n \oplus C_n $$  
Where \( R_n \) = Resonance operator, \( C_n \) = Cognition vector

---

### Number Genesis Formulas  
**From Paper II – Triadic Number Genesis (1–9)**  
Nested emergence:  
$$ N_i = \sum_{j=1}^{3} T_{i,j} $$  
Symbolic triads: 1 = Seed, 2 = Mirror, 3 = Echo

---

### Dimensional Triads (1D–9D)  
**From Paper III – Dimensional Triads**  
Dimensional mapping:  
$$ D_n = \{T_n, V_n, S_n\} $$  
Where \( V_n \) = Vibration vector, \( S_n \) = Symbolic scaffold

---

### Entropy Harmonics  
**From Triadic Framework for Quantum Mechanics – Entropy’s Harmonic**  
Harmonic descent:  
$$ E = -\sum p_i \log(p_i) \cdot H_n $$  
Where \( H_n \) = Harmonic glyph index

---

### Resonance Operator Formalization  
**From Resonance Operator @() — Formalization.docx**  
Operator syntax:  
```python
@() → triadic_resonance_loop(dim, glyph, echo)
