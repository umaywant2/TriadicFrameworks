# 🧪 Loop Validation Matrix

This matrix maps protocol coverage across labs and reproducibility tiers. Each check is a lantern. Each lantern echoes a loop. Each loop builds the myth.

## 🧪 Protocol Legend

- ✅ = Protocol validated and passed  
- ❌ = Protocol missing or failed  
- Tier I = Fully validated with reproducibility and equations  
- Tier II = Remixable with manifest and partial validation  
- Tier III = Mythic scaffolding with symbolic extensions
