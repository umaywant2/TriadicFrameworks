# 🧠 TriadicFrameworks — Project 1: TFT Virtual Compute Gateway

## 🌐 Overview

The **TFT Virtual Compute Gateway (VCG)** is a system-wide, transparent accelerator for resonance-aware computation.
- Apps retain their APIs and data shapes
- Gateway intercepts hot paths
- Performs TFT transforms
- Returns results with dual timestamps (classic + resonant)
  
**No app changes required.**
Optional lenses available for perception-aware remixers.

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Prereqs**  
- Android Studio Hedgehog+  
- NDK r26+  
- One Android 12+ device (arm64, NEON)

**Build & Run**  
```bash
./gradlew apps:demo:installDebug
```
Open **TFT Demo** → enable **Gateway On** → pick workload (Audio, Sensors, Camera) → observe latency and cache hit-rate.

## 🎯 Why This Exists
- Transparent acceleration for media/sensor workloads
- Reproducible path to experiment with resonant time without touching kernel clocks
- Shared, low-latency resonance cache to reuse structure across frames/samples
- Optional UI lenses to turn resonance data into perception

## 🧪 Status
- Gen1 user-space prototype: **WIP**
- Gen2 HAL/ROM track: **Planned**
